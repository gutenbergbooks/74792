</div>


<p>We devote the fourth volume of our series of Western
Travels to the reprint of Fortescue Cuming’s <i>Sketches of a
Tour to the Western Country</i>—the tour having been made
in 1807-1809, the publication itself issuing from a Pittsburg
press in 1810.</p>

<p>Of Cuming himself, we have no information save such as
is gleaned from his book. He appears to have been an
Englishman of culture and refinement, who had travelled
extensively in other lands—notably the West Indies,
France, Switzerland, and Italy. It is certain that he journeyed
to good purpose, with an intelligent, open mind, free
from local prejudices, and with trained habits of observation.
Cuming was what one may call a good traveller—he
endured the inconveniences, annoyances, and vicissitudes
of the road, especially in a new and rough country,
with equanimity and philosophic patience, deliberately
making the best of each day’s happenings, thus proving
himself an experienced and agreeable man of the world.</p>

<p>The journeys narrated were taken during two succeeding
years. The first, in January, 1807, was a pedestrian tour
from Philadelphia to Pittsburg. Arriving in the latter city
on the second of February, after twenty-seven days upon
the road, the remainder of the winter, the spring, and the
early summer were passed at Pittsburg. On the eighteenth
of July following, our traveller took boat from Pittsburg,
and made his way down the Ohio to the Kentucky entrepôt
at Maysville—where he arrived the thirtieth of the month.
Mounting a horse, he made a brief trip through Kentucky
as far as Lexington and Frankfort, returning to Maysville
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>on the fifth of August. The following day, he crossed the
Ohio, and after examining lands in the vicinity, proceeded
partly on foot, partly by stage and saddle, over the newly-opened
state road of Ohio, through Chillicothe, Lancaster,
and Zanesville to Wheeling; thence back to Pittsburg,
where he arrived the evening of August 21.</p>

<p>The following year (1808), Cuming begins his narrative
at the point on the Ohio where he had left the river the
previous year—at Maysville, whence he embarked on the
seventh of May for Mississippi Territory. With the same
fulness of detail and accurate notation that characterize
his former narrative, Cuming describes the voyage down
the Ohio and the Mississippi until his arrival at Bayou
Pierre on the sixth of June, after a month afloat.</p>

<p>Starting from Bruinsbury, at the mouth of Bayou Pierre,
August 22, he took a horseback trip through the settlements
of Mississippi Territory lying along the river and
some distance inland on its tributaries—Cole’s Creek, St.
Catharine’s Bayou, the Homochito, etc.—penetrating the
then Spanish territory of West Florida as far as Baton
Rouge, and returning by a similar route to Bruinsbury,
where he arrived the fifteenth of September.</p>

<p>At this point Cuming’s tour is concluded. In order to
give completeness to the work, however, the first editor
added the journal of a voyage taken in 1799 “by a gentleman
of accurate observation, a passenger in a New Orleans
boat.” From just above Bayou Pierre, this anonymous
author departed on the ninth of February for New Orleans,
where he arrived on the twenty-third of the same month.
Embarking therefrom March 12, he reached Philadelphia
after a month’s voyage via Havana and the Atlantic shore.
His narrative is far less effective than that of Cuming.</p>

<p>Like a well bred man of affairs, Cuming never intrudes
his private business upon our attention; but incidentally we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>learn that his first Western journey from Pittsburg was undertaken
at least in part to observe some lands in Ohio,
which he had previously purchased in Europe, and with
whose situation and location he was agreeably surprised.
The journey to Mississippi appears to have been undertaken
with a view to making his home in that territory.
The place and date signed to the preface—“Mississippi
territory, 20th Oct. 1809”—would indicate that he had
decided upon remaining where he had found the social
life so much to his taste, and some of his former friends and
acquaintances had settled.</p>

<p>It is the natural impulse of almost every traveller to
record the events of a somewhat unusual tour. Cuming
wished, also, to afford information to Europeans and Eastern
men of “a country, in its infancy, which from its rapid
improvement in a very few years, will form a wonderful
contrast to its present state.” His attitude was sympathetic
towards the new and raw regions through which he
travelled; nevertheless this fact does not appear to have
unduly affected his purpose of giving an accurate picture
of what he saw. He does not slur over the disadvantages,
nor extenuate any of the crudeness or vulgarity; but at the
same time portrays the possibilities of the new land, its
remarkable growth, its opportunities for development, and
the vigor and enterprise of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>In plain, dispassionate style, he has given us a picture of
American life in the West, at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, that for clear-cut outlines and fidelity of presentation
has the effect of a series of photographic representations.
In this consists the value of the book for students of
American history. We miss entirely those evidences of
amused tolerance and superficial criticism that characterize
so many English books of his day, recounting travels
in the United States—a state of mind sometimes developing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>into strong prejudice and evident distaste, such as made
Dickens’s <i>American Notes</i> a caricature of conditions in the
new country.</p>

<p>It is essentially a backwoods life to which Cuming introduces
us, although not in the first stages of its struggle for
existence. Indian alarms are a thing of the past, a large
percentage of the land is cleared, the people have better
dwellings than in the log-cabin days, there is now rude
abundance and plenty, and the beginnings of educational
opportunities, social intercourse, and the amenities of
civilized life. The pioneers themselves—Indian fighters
and skilful hunters—have become rare. Here and there
Cuming encounters a former Indian captive, like Andrew
Ellison, or a scout and ranger, like Peter Neiswonger; but
as a rule it is the second generation whom he meets, or
members of the second tide of emigrants that came in after
the Revolution—officers in the army, younger sons of the
better classes, who by energy and capacity bettered their
fortunes in the West, built for themselves good homes, laid
out towns, developed orchards, farms, and plantations, and
were living in that atmosphere of prosperity which heralded
the ultimate fortunes of the new land.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the inheritances of the older days of struggle
and primitive society are still in evidence—the lack of
facilities at the small country inns, the coarseness and rudeness
of the manner of living, the heavy drinking and boisterous
amusements of the young, the fighting, the incivility
to travellers, the boorishness of manners. All these are
relics of the early days when the rough struggle with the
wilderness developed the cruder rather than the finer virtues
of men. On the other hand, as we have already
pointed out, Cuming shows us the hopeful elements of this
new land: not only its wonderful material prosperity, its
democratic spirit and sense of fairness, but its adaptability,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>its hospitality for new ideas, the beginnings of the fine art
of good living, and eagerness to promote schools, churches,
and the organizations for the higher life.</p>

<p>Some of the particular features recorded by Cuming, that
are now obsolete, are the use of lotteries for raising money
for public purposes, and the prevalence of highway robbery
in the unsettled parts of the country. The restlessness of
the population is also worthy of note—the long journeys
for trivial purposes, the abandoned settlements in Kentucky
and Illinois.</p>

<p>Especially valuable for purposes of comparison, is Cuming’s
accurate account of the towns through which he passed—their
size and appearance, number and kind of manufactures,
business methods and interests. Characteristic of the
period also, is the enterprise of the inhabitants—townsites
laid out at every available position, speculation in
lands, and large confidence in the future of the region. In
that confidence Cuming appears fully to have shared.
Already, he tells us, food-stuffs were being exported to
Europe, the growth of the cotton industry promised large
returns, the richness of the soil and the resources and fertility
of the land fostered high hopes.</p>

<p>In regard to social conditions, our author writes at a time
when the formerly uniform and homogeneous character of
the Western population was beginning to break up, especially
in the slave states and territories, and when the professional
classes and large land-owners were taking a leading
position in affairs. He notes particularly the importance
and assumption of leadership on the part of the lawyers.
The virulent excitement of political life is one of the features
of his observations that his first editor attempted to
excuse and modify. It was doubtless true that the incidents
attendant upon the arrest and trial of Burr had especially
aroused the section through which Cuming passed. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>is probable, however, that his portrayal of the animosity
of political divisions is substantially accurate; and that not
only did “politics run high” at the tavern and political
club, but it controlled the social coterie, and in early American
society adjusted lines of relationship more strictly than
is evident to-day.</p>

<p>The areas which Cuming visited were those, with the
exception of Tennessee, in which were to be found the most
characteristic features of Western life. Western Pennsylvania
and Northwestern Virginia comprised a homogeneous
population, living under similar conditions. Closely allied
was Kentucky, although it was beginning to be modified by
settled conditions, the prosperity of low, rich pasture lands,
and its distance from Eastern markets. In Ohio, however,
Cuming encountered the New England element—but
well mixed with Southerners on the Virginia bounty lands,
French of the Gallipolis settlement, and New Jersey and
Middle States emigration to the region of the Miamis. His
narrative, continued down the Ohio, shows the scarcity of
population in Indiana and Illinois, and in Kentucky below
Louisville; also the frontier character of that region as far
down the Mississippi as the Natchez district. Here again,
Cuming meets with an area of settlement begun under the
British rule of West Florida, and continued under Spanish
authority, until a few years before his voyage. In Mississippi,
he portrays to us the beginnings of plantation life—the
large estates, with gangs of negroes; the hospitality,
cultivation, and charm of the upper classes, jostled by the
rude waifs and strays that the river traffic wafted to their
landings. In spite of diversities, the characteristics of
Western life had much sameness—the mingling of the population,
the shifting of people from all sections, and the
dependence upon the rivers as the great arteries of Western
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>commerce, with its ultimate outlet by way of the Mississippi
and New Orleans.</p>

<p>Cuming’s work was not immediately published after
writing. The manuscript passed into the possession of
Zadok Cramer, a Pittsburg printer who was particularly interested
in Ohio and Mississippi navigation, for which he
published a technical guide called <i>The Navigator</i>, that ran
through numerous editions. Cramer annotated Cuming’s
manuscript, adding thereto a considerable appendix of
heterogeneous matter—collected, as he says in his advertisement,
“from various sources while the press was going
on with the work, and frequently was I hurried by the compositors
to furnish copy from hour to hour.” This material,
much of it irrelevant and reprinted from other works, the
present Editor has thought best to omit. It ranges from a
description of the bridge at Trenton to Pike’s tour through
Louisiana—embracing such diverse matter as “Of the
character of the Quakers,” “Sculptures of the American
Aborigines,” and “Particulars of John Law’s Mississippi
Scheme.”</p>

<p>The hope of Cramer that a second edition would soon be
called for, was not fulfilled. Put forth in 1810, the book
has never been reprinted until the present edition, which it is
believed will be welcomed by students of American history.</p>

<p>As in former volumes of the series, Louise Phelps Kellogg,
Ph.D., of the Wisconsin Historical Library, has
assisted in the preparation of the notes. The Editor desires,
also, to acknowledge his obligations to Mrs. Frances C.
Wordin, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, for valuable information
concerning her grandfather, Dr. John Cummins, of
Bayou Pierre, Mississippi.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The writer of the following tour would not trouble the
reader with a Preface, did not some circumstances render it
in a certain degree necessary.</p>

<p>It might be asked why he had not commenced the tour
with a particular description of Philadelphia. His reasons
for not doing so were, in the first place, Philadelphia is a city
so minutely described in every modern geographical publication,
that few readers are unacquainted with its local situation
between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, its regularity
of plan, its rapid progress, &amp;c. Whereas the country
through which the author travelled has been very little treated
of by tourists, of course is little known to strangers; though
an account of its appearance, its natural properties, its improvements,
and the manners of its mixed population, perhaps
merits a place on the shelves of the literati, as much as
the numerous tours and travels through Europe, Asia and
Africa with which they are loaded. Indeed, in one point of
view, such a book may be much more useful, as it may serve
for a record of the situation of a country, in its infancy,
which from its rapid improvement in a very few years, will
form a wonderful contrast to its present state, while the
trans-Atlantick travellers have to treat of countries either
arrived at the highest state of improvement, or of others
buried in the gloom of ignorance and barbarity, and
of course both stationary, and therefore not affording
any variety of consequence, during the two last centuries,
(in which time they have been the theme of so many
able pens) excepting the style of writing and manner of
description.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>In the second place—It was the author’s wish to condense
as much into one cheap volume as he could make it contain,
and had he entered into minute descriptions of places the
best known, he would [have] had so much the less room for
the original matter, with which he intended to constitute
the bulk of the work.</p>

<p>It was intended to have put the work to the press in the
winter of 1807, the year in which the tour commenced, but a
series of disappointments essayed by the author, has unavoidably
postponed it, and has given him an opportunity
of adding to the original plan, some account of the lower
parts of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and the countries
washed by them, particularly the Mississippi territory,
which has become of great importance to the United States,
and is not without its value to Europe, from its immense
supply of cotton to the European manufacturers.</p>

<p>{viii} As the intention of the author was the increase of
information, he makes no apology for the plainness of his
style, and he expects, on that account, to be spared any criticism.
Should however any one think proper to bestow a
leisure hour in the remarking of his inaccuracies, or the
incorrectness of his language, he can have no possible
objection, as criticism of that kind always tends to general
improvement.</p>

<p>On 8th January 1807, I left Philadelphia on foot, accompanying
a wagon which carried my baggage. I preferred
this mode of travelling for several reasons. Not being
pressed for time I wished to see as much of the country as
possible; the roads were in fine order, and I had no incentive
to make me desirous of reaching any point of my intended
journey before my baggage. With respect to expence, there
was little difference in my travelling in this manner, or on
horseback, or in the stage, had I been unincumbered with
baggage; for the delay on the road, awaiting the slow pace
of a loaded wagon, which is not quite three miles an hour,
and not exceeding twenty-six miles on a winter’s day, will occasion
as great expence to a traveller in a distance exceeding
two such days’ journey, as the same distance performed
otherwise in less than half the time, including the charge of
horse or stage hire.</p>

<p>The first object which struck me on the road, was the new
bridge over the Schuylkill which does honour to its inventor
for its originality of architecture, and its excellence of mechanism.
There are two piers, the westernmost of which is a
work perhaps unexampled in hydraulick architecture, from
the depth to which it is sunk; the rock on which it stands
being forty-one feet nine inches below common {10} high
tides. Both piers were built within cofferdams: the design
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>for the western was furnished by William Weston, esq. of
Gainsborough in England, a celebrated hydraulick engineer.
Eight hundred thousand feet of timber, board measure,
were employed in and about it. Mr. Samuel Robinson of
Philadelphia, executed the work of the piers under the directions
of a president and five directors, who also superintended
the mason work done by Mr. Thomas Vickers, on an uncommon
plan, which has answered the intention perfectly
well. The walls of the abutments and wings are perpendicular
without buttresses, and supported by interior offsets.
The eastern abutment is founded on a rock, the western
on piles. There are near eight thousand tons of masonry
in the western pier, many of the stones in it, as well as in
the eastern, weighing from three to twelve tons. Several
massive chains are worked in with the masonry, stretched
across the piers in various positions; and the exterior is
clamped and finished in the most substantial manner.</p>

<p>The frame of the superstructure was designed and erected
by Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport in Massachusetts,
combining in its principles, that of ring posts and braces
with a stone arch. The platform for travelling rises only
eight feet from a horizontal line. The foot ways are five
feet in width, elevated above the carriage ways, and neatly
protected by posts and chains.</p>

<p>The whole of the bridge is covered by a roof, and the
sides closed in, to preserve the timber from the decay occasioned
by exposure to the weather. The side covering is
done in imitation of masonry by sprinkling it with stone
dust, while the painting was fresh: this is a novel mode of
ornamenting and protecting the surfaces of wooden work
exposed to weather, which from its goodness and cheapness
will probably be brought into general use. The work of the
{11} roof and covering was done by Mr. Owen Biddle, house
carpenter in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<p>The bridge was six years in building, was finished in
1805, and cost in work and materials two hundred and
thirty-five thousand dollars. The scite was purchased
from the corporation of Philadelphia for forty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>This is the only covered wooden bridge we know of, excepting
one over the Limmat in Switzerland, built by the
same carpenter who erected the so much celebrated bridge
of Schauffhausen, since destroyed, the model of which I
have seen, and I think this of Schuylkill deserves the preference
both for simplicity and strength. It is 550 feet long,
and the abutments and wing walls are 750, making in all
1300 feet; the span of the middle arch is 195 feet, and that
of the other two 150 each; it is 42 feet wide; the carriage
way is 31 feet above the surface of the river, and the lower
part of the roof is 13 feet above the carriage way; the depth
of the water to the rock at the western pier is 42 feet, and at
the eastern 21 feet.—The amount of the toll, which is
very reasonable, was 14,600 dollars the first year after it was
finished, which must increase very much in a country so
rapidly improving. The proprietors are a company who
have built commodious wharves on each side of the river,
both for protection to the abutments of the bridge, and for
the use of the city.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>{12} The Schuylkill is a fine river nearly two hundred yards
broad at the bridge. It rises in the Cushetunk mountains
about a hundred and twenty miles to the N. W. of Philadelphia.
It is navigable for flat boats from the populous
town of Reading about fifty miles above Philadelphia, but
its navigation is impeded by falls about eight miles above
the city, and by others about five miles above it, to which
latter ones the tide flows, from its conflux with the Delaware
four miles below Philadelphia. It supplies the city with
water, pumped by steam<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> from a reservoir, with which {13}
the river communicates by a canal near the bridge, into a
cistern, from whence it is conveyed by pipes through the
streets and to the houses, plugs being fixed at convenient
distances for supplying the fire engines, for which there are
too frequent use, from the quantity of timber still used in
building, and from the fuel, which is chiefly wood.</p>

<p>The banks of the Schuylkill being hilly, afford charming
situations for country houses, in which the wealthy citizens
of Philadelphia find a secure retreat from the unhealthy
air of the town during the heats of summer. A good house,
a spacious green house, fine gardens and a demesne formerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>owned by the late Robert Morris, esq.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are a fine termination
to the view up the river from the bridge.</p>

<p>There is a turnpike road of sixty-six miles from Philadelphia
to Lancaster, which my wagonner left at Downingstown
about half way, keeping to the right along a new road, which is
also intended for a turnpike road to Harrisburgh, and which
passes through New Holland, where he had some goods to
deliver. Downingstown is a village of about fifty middling
houses.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The east branch of Brandywine creek crosses the
road here, as the west branch does about eight miles further.—These
two branches unite twelve or fourteen miles below,
and fall into the Delaware near Wilmington, about twenty
miles below their junction. The Brandywine is noted for a
battle fought on its banks near its confluence with the
Delaware, between the British army under Sir William
Howe and the American under General Washington, who
endeavoured to oppose the progress of the enemy to Philadelphia,
from the head of Chesapeak bay where they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>landed. The conflict was obstinate, but the British being
in great force, the Americans {14} were obliged to retreat,
after heavy loss on both sides.</p>

<p>The Brandywine runs through a rich and well settled
country, and abounds with mills, where a vast quantity of
flour is manufactured for exportation.—Pequea creek which
falls into the Susquehannah, crosses the road about four
miles from the west branch of Brandywine. Five miles
further accompanying my wagonner, I turned to the left
from the Harrisburgh turnpike road, and in six miles more
came to New Holland, which is a long straggling town of one
hundred and fifty houses in one street, from whence it is seven
miles to Conestoga creek. From the hill just above, I was
struck with the romantick situation of a fine bridge over the
creek below, more particularly as I came upon it unexpectedly.
The creek is about eighty yards wide, tumbling its
rapid current, over an irregular rocky bottom and disappearing
round the foot of a wooded hill, almost as soon as
seen. The man who built the bridge lives on the opposite
side. The toll not answering his expectations, he would
have been a great sufferer, had not the state taken it off his
hands and reimbursed his expences; since when, the toll
has been taken off.—It is five miles from this bridge to
Lancaster.</p>

<p>The face of the country between Philadelphia and Lancaster
is hilly, and variegated with woods and cultivated
farms. It is extremely well inhabited and consists of almost
every variety of soil, from sandy and light, to a rich black
mould, which last quality is observable generally between
New Holland and Lancaster, except on the heights on each
bank of the Conestoga. The first settlers of all this tract
were English, Irish, and German, but the latter have gradually
purchased from the others, and have got the best
lands generally into their possession. They {15} are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>frugal and industrious, are good farmers, and consequently
a wealthy people.</p>

<p>Lancaster is supposed to be the largest inland town in the
United States. It is in a healthy and pleasant situation,
on the western slope of a hill, and consists of two principal
streets, compactly built with brick and stone, and
well paved and lighted, crossing each other at right
angles. There is a handsome and commodious court-house
of brick in the centre, which, in my opinion is injurious to
the beauty of the town, by obstructing the vista of the principal
streets. There are several other streets parallel to the
principal ones the whole containing about eight hundred
houses. The houses for publick worship are a German
Lutheran, a German Calvinist, a Presbyterian, an Episcopalian,
a Moravian, a Quaker, and a Roman Catholick
church, amongst which the German Lutheran is the most
conspicuous from its size and handsome spire: it has also
an organ.—There is a strong jail built with stone, and a
brick market house. What in my opinion does most
honour to the town is its poor house, which is delightfully
situated near Conestoga creek about a mile from the town
on the right of the turnpike road towards Philadelphia. It
is a large and commodious building, and is supported partly
by the labour of those paupers who are able to work, and
partly by a fine farm, which is annexed to it. There are
several private manufacturies in Lancaster, amongst which
are three breweries and three tanyards, but it is principally
noted for its rifles, muskets, and pistols, the first of which are
esteemed the best made in the United States. The inhabitants
are chiefly the descendants of the first German settlers,
and are a quiet, orderly people—They are estimated at
about four thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>This has been the seat of government of Pennsylvania
since 1799, but it is not rendered permanently {16} so by an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>act of the legislature, which occasions attempts being made
annually at every session of that body to remove it.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
eastern members advocating Philadelphia on account of
its trade and population, and the western members endeavouring
to have it placed as near to the centre of the
state as possible, which they contend will also shortly be
the centre of population, from the rapid manner in which the
country to the westward of the Allegheny mountains is
settling. I was present at a very animated debate, on the
subject in the house of representatives, during which much
good argument, mixed with several sprightly and keen
flashes of genuine wit, was used, but it all terminated, as it
has hitherto invariably done, in favour of Lancaster—Of
many situations proposed, Harrisburgh seemed to have the
greatest number of advocates.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Lancaster is so populous and the seat of
government besides, it is but a dull town with respect to
society. The manners and taste of the inhabitants are not
yet sufficiently refined by education, or intercourse with
strangers, to make it a desirable situation for the residence
of a person who wishes to enjoy the otium cum dignitate.
An alteration in that respect will doubtless take place with
the rising generation, whose education, the easy circumstances
of the present inhabitants, enable to pay a proper
attention to, particularly as they seem desirous to balance
their own deficiencies in literature and the polite accomplishments,
by their attention to their children in those
particulars. There is no theatre, no assemblies, no literary
societies, nor any other publick entertainment, except occasionally
an itinerant exhibition of wax-work, or a puppet-show:
{17} but there are taverns without number, at
some of which I have been informed, private gambling is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
very customary.</p>

<p>There are horse races here annually, which last a week on
a course on the common to the westward of the town, which
like most other races in this country, are for the mere purposes
of jockeying horses, and betting, and are not followed
by balls and other social meetings of both sexes, as at amusements
of the same kind in Europe. Shooting with the rifle,
is a favourite amusement, at which they are very dexterous,
meeting at taverns at short distances from town, to shoot,
sometimes at a mark for wagers, and sometimes at turkeys
provided by the tavern keeper, at so much a shot, the turkey
being the prize of the killer of it—the distance is generally,
one hundred yards, and always with a single ball.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the difficulties, and uncommon perseverance of the company
in building the Schuylkill bridge, we give the following instance: The British troops
when at Philadelphia had formed a bridge of boats over the Schuylkill, one of which
had been accidentally sunk in 1777, twenty-eight feet below common low water.
It occupied a part of the area of the western <i>coffer dam</i>, with one end projecting
under two of the piles of the inner row, and had nearly rendered the erection
abortive. It was first discovered on pumping out the dam, in 1802; and was perfectly
sound, after the lapse of 25 years. The iron work had not the least appearance
of rust, or the wood (which was common oak) of decay. The taking this
boat to pieces, the straining the dam, and the leaks in consequence, were the chief
causes of an extra expenditure, by the company, of more than 4000 dollars, hardly
and perilously disbursed in pumping (which alone cost from 500 to 700 dollars
weekly) and other labour, during forty-one days and nights in the midst of a most
inclement winter. <i>Mem. Phila. Ag. Soc.</i>—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> This water steam engine, otherwise called the waterworks, is a work of great
magnitude. It cost 150 thousand dollars, and is capable of raising about 4,500,000
gallons of water in 24 hours, with which the city is daily supplied through wooden
pipes. The reservoir, into which the water is thrown, is capable of holding 20,000
gallons, and is of a sufficient height to supply the citizens with water in the upper
stories of their highest houses. The first stone of this building was laid on the 2d
May, 1799, and it was completed in 1801-2. The works belong to the city, and the
citizens pay a water tax equal to the expence of keeping the engine in motion, which
amounts to about 8,000 dollars annually. The building stands in the centre square,
and consequently spoils the view down Market street. The trees and houses adjacent,
look as black and gloomy as those in Pittsburgh, arising from the smoke

purchased in 1770, and had formed part of the manor of Springetsbury. It is
now within Fairmount Park. Morris, known as the “financier of the American
Revolution,” was an Englishman who, emigrating to Pennsylvania in 1747, became
a prominent merchant of Philadelphia. After serving as a delegate to the Continental
Congress, and signing the Declaration of Independence, he was assigned
the difficult task of procuring funds for the war. To his support was due the
maintenance of an army in the field during the disastrous years of 1776 and 1777;
while his chief accomplishment was financing the campaign that led to the battle
of Yorktown. After retiring from the superintendency of finance in 1784, Morris
served in the Pennsylvania legislature (1786), the Constitutional Convention
(1787), and the United States Senate (1789-95), declining the position of Secretary
of the Treasury in Washington’s cabinet. In later life his affairs became involved,
and he spent four years (1798-1802) in a debtor’s prison. See Sumner, <i>Robert

</div>


<p>On Thursday 29th January I left Lancaster on foot, proceeding
along the Harrisburgh road, at a steady pace of
about three miles and a half an hour. The weather was
remarkable fine, and the road in excellent order, and what
was remarkable for the season, a little dusty. About a mile
and a half from Lancaster, I past a turnpike toll gate, from
a little beyond which I got the last view of the steeples of
that town, and soon after I crossed a stone bridge over a
branch of Conestoga creek. The road continued {18} fine,
and the country rich, laid out in large farms, with good
dwelling houses of brick and stone, and immense barns.
Though hill and dale, woods and cultivated farms, presented
themselves alternately yet there was nothing very striking
in the scenery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>The road continued fine, nine miles, to a rivulet called
Big Chickey, which I crossed over on an Indian bridge,
which is a high tree cut down so as to fall across the stream
from bank to bank, and then its branches lopped off.
The banks being high, and the bridge long and narrow, my
nerves were so discomposed when I reached the middle, that
I had like to have fallen off, but balancing and tottering, I at
length reached the end.</p>

<p>Two miles further I had to cross another Indian bridge
over Little Chickey creek, which I did boldly, without any
difficulty; which is one proof of the use of practice and
experience.</p>

<p>The road now became very bad, the turnpike intended
from Lancaster to Harrisburgh not being as yet finished any
further.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The country also is not so highly improved as in
the neighbourhood of Lancaster, the inhabitants still residing
in their original small log houses, though they have generally
good and spacious stone barns.</p>

<p>After four hours walking, I arrived at Elizabethtown
eighteen miles from Lancaster,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and stopped at the sign of
General Wayne, where for a five penny bit (six cents and a
quarter) I got a bowl of excellent egg punch, and a crust
of bread.</p>

<p>It is surprising that at so short a distance from Lancaster,
the necessaries of life should be at least a third cheaper,
which on enquiry I found them here.</p>

<p>This village contains about thirty tolerable houses—has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>a meeting-house, and a school, when a master {19} can be
got, which is not always the case, the place having now
been some months vacant, to whom the trustees ensure
twenty-five scholars, at two dollars each per quarter, which
being only two hundred dollars per annum, I would have
supposed insufficient for his support, if at the same time I
had not been informed that his board and lodging in the most
respectable manner, will not cost him above eighty dollars
a year, in this cheap and plentiful country.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>After resting about an hour, and not feeling at all fatigued,
at half past four, I proceeded for Middleton, eight miles
further, first loading one of the barrels of my gun with a
running ball, as I had to pass near where one Eshelman was
robbed and murdered last fall.</p>

<p>The road over Connewago hills was bad, and by the time
I arrived at the bridge over Connewago creek, three miles
from Elizabethtown, my left foot began to pain me, so that
I was forced to slacken my pace, which made it dark before
I arrived at Swatara creek, when the pain had much increased,
which was occasioned by my stepping through the
ice up to my knees in a run which crossed the road, which
the darkness prevented my seeing.</p>

<p>The boat was at the other side of the creek, and the
German family at the ferry-house let me kick my heels at
the door until I was quite chilled, before they invited me in,
which old Mrs. Smith did at last with a very bad grace, and
she almost scolded me for risking the dropping on her very
dirty floor, the spirits of turpentine, with which I was wetting
the feet of my stockings to prevent my catching cold,
a phial of which I carried in my pocket for that purpose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>In about half an hour, which appeared to me an age, the
boat returned, and I gladly left the dirty, boorish, inhospitable
mansion, crossed the creek in a canoe, hauled over
by a rope extended from bank to bank, about 70 yards, and
in a few minutes after {20} I found myself in Mrs. Wentz’s
excellent inn, the sign of general Washington in Middleton.
My foot being much blistered, I bathed it in cold water, and
then injudiciously opened the blisters with a lancet, and
spunged them with spirits of turpentine: I then got a good
supper and an excellent bed, but my foot pained me so
much as to prevent my sleeping, so I arose early, unrefreshed,
and breakfasted with my landlady, an agreeable, well bred
woman.</p>

<p>The view down the Susquehannah from Mrs. Wentz’s
back piazza is very fine. The town contains about a hundred
houses and is well and handsomely situated about
half a mile above the conflux of Swatara creek with Susquehannah
river, the former of which forms a good harbour
for boats, which it is in contemplation to join to the
Schuylkill by a canal, in order to give Philadelphia the
benefit of the navigation of the Susquehannah through its
long course above Middleton. If this is carried into effect,
it will draw to Philadelphia a vast quantity of produce, which
now goes to Baltimore.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The Susquehannah is a noble river, here about a mile
wide, with fine sloping wooded banks, and abounds with
rock-fish, perch, mullet, eels, suckers, cat-fish and white
salmon, which last is described as a fine fish from seven to
fifteen pounds weight, but a distinct species from the red
salmon of the northern rivers. Notwithstanding their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>plenty, Mrs. Wentz assured me that she was seldom gratified
with a dish of fish; for though there are many poor people
in the town and neighbourhood, who might make a good
living by fishing, she says they are too lazy to do any thing
more than will procure them some whiskey, in addition to a
miserable subsistence, which a very little labour will suffice
for in a country where work is so well paid for, and where
the necessaries of life are so abundant and cheap.</p>

<p>Was it not that the Susquehannah abounds with {21} falls,
shallows and rapids which impede the navigation, it would
be one of the most useful rivers in the world, as its different
branches from its different sources, embrace a wonderful
extent of country, settled, or rapidly settling, and abounding
in wheat and maize (Indian corn,) which most probably will
always be staples of the large and flourishing state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The road to Harrisburgh leads parallel to the Susquehannah,
in some places close to the river, and never more
distant from it than a quarter of a mile, along a very pleasant
level, bounded on the right by a ridge of low, but
steep wooded hills, approaching and receding at intervals,
and affording a fine shelter from the northerly winds, to the
farms between them and the river; which perhaps is one
reason that the orchards are so numerous and so fine in
this tract.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen in any country, a road more pleasant
than this, either from its own goodness, or the richness and
variety of prospect. The Susquehannah on the left about
three quarters of a mile wide; sometimes appearing, and
sometimes concealed by orchards, groves or clumps of
wood. The fine wooded islands in the river. The mountains
which terminate the ridge called the South mountain
(which crosses part of Virginia, and the southern part of
this state) rising abruptly from the margin of the river, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>which they are charmingly reflected, altogether form a
scenery truly delightful.</p>

<p>About three miles below Harrisburgh the mountains terminate,
and the south bank of the river becomes more varied,
though still hilly; and here on an elevated promontory, with
a commanding view of the river, from above Harrisburgh to
below Middleton, is a large, and apparently fine stone house,
owned by general Simpson who resides in it on his farm,
and is proprietor of a ferry much frequented by the western
wagonners, as the road that way is {22} shorter by two miles,
than that by Harrisburgh.—He farms out the ferry on his
side for about three hundred dollars per annum, while on
this side the proprietor rents it at four hundred and seventy.
The value of this ferry called Chambers’s, may serve to
convey some idea of the state of travelling in this country,
particularly if one reflects that there are many other well
frequented ferries where publick roads cross the river,
within thirty miles both above and below this one, and which
are all great avenues to the western country.</p>

<p>When two miles from the ferry I observed a long line of
sleds, horses, men, &amp;c. crossing on the ice; which scene, at
that distance had a curious and picturesque appearance, as
the ice was glassy, and in consequence they appeared to be
moving on the surface of the water, in which their shadows
inverted and reflected as in a mirror, struck the eye with
very grotesque imagery.</p>

<p>Some labourers who were at work in a barn at the ferry-house,
and of whom I was asking some questions relative
to the country, were much astonished at my double barrelled
gun, admiring its work and lightness, and calling it a <i>curious
creature</i>.</p>

<p>When within a mile and a half of Harrisburgh,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>cupola of its court-house, and the roofs of the houses of the
town are seen peeping over the trees, and have a good effect.</p>

<p>At one o’clock I entered that town, turning to the left
over Paxton creek bridge. I stopt at the ferry-house, which
is also a tavern, but appearance of accommodation not being
very promising, I continued my walk along the bank of the
river, and stopt at another tavern, where I asked if I could
have a bed that night. A dirty looking girl at the stove
drawled but that she believed I might. I then asked for
some mulled wine. She said eggs were scarce, and she
could not get any. From these symptoms of {23} carelessness,
I thought it best to try my fortune a little further; so
putting on my shot belt and taking my gun, I quietly walked
out in search of a place of more civil reception, and fortunately
I entered Bennet’s, the sign of the white horse, fronting
the river, at the corner of the principal cross street,
which leads to the market place. I say <i>fortunately</i>, for I
found it an excellent, plentiful and well frequented house,
and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, two fine girls, his daughters by
a former wife, and a Mr. Fisher an assistant, and apparently
some relation, all attentive and studious to please.</p>

<p>After getting some refreshment I wrote some letters, and
carried them to the post-office. The office being shut, the
postmaster very civilly invited me into his parlour, to settle
for the postage, where seeing a large map of Pennsylvania,
I took the opportunity of tracing my journey, which the
postmaster observing, he very politely assisted me in it,
pointing out the most proper route. There were some
ladies in the room, apparently on a visit, and there was an
air of socialty and refinement throughout, which was very
pleasing.</p>

<p>Leaving the post-office I walked through the town. It
contains about two hundred and fifty houses, most of them
very good, some of brick, some of stone, and some of wood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>The principal street runs nearly east and west, and has two
small market-houses in the centre, where the street is
widened purposely into a small square. Parallel to this
main street is a street charmingly situated on the bank of the
Susquehannah, open to the river on the side next it, and
tolerably well built on the other, having a wide foot way,
in some parts paved, and marked in its whole length by a
row of Lombardy poplars regularly planted, which serves
also to shade the houses from the scorching rays of the summers
sun. This street, though at present wide enough, has
not been laid {24} out sufficiently so to provide against the
gradual encroachment of the river, on its steep gravelly
bank of about twenty feet high above the common level of
the water. The view from every part of this street is very
beautiful, both up and down the river, about five miles
each way—terminated upwards by the long ridge of the
Blue mountains, through a gap in which of about three
miles long, which is also open to the view, the river rolls its
rapid current, contracted there to less than half a mile
wide. While downwards the eye rests on the South mountain,
impending over general Simpson’s house, which in its
turn seems to overhang the river, from the high promontory
on which it is situated. Several islands add to the beauty
of the view, particularly one, on which is a fine farm of
nearly one hundred acres just opposite the town.</p>

<p>The court-house is near the market square on the principal
cross street, and is a handsome plain brick building of
two lofty stories, with a cupola rising from the centre of
the roof, remarkable for its vane of copper gilt, representing
an Indian chief, as large as the life, with a bow in his left
hand, and a tomahawk in the act of cutting, in the right.
The house is about seventy feet by fifty, with two small
receding wings. The hall for the court is very neat, spacious
and convenient; doors opening from it into the record and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>prothonotary’s offices in the wings. A fine easy double
staircase leads to the great room over the hall for the courts.
This room is now used as a temporary place of worship by
the English Presbyterians, until their own meeting-house is
finished, which is of brick and in great forwardness. From
each corner of this room a door opens into the register
office, the library and two jury rooms.</p>

<p>There is as yet no other place of publick worship in Harrisburgh,
except an old wooden house used as such, by a
congregation of German Lutherans.</p>

<p>{28, <i>i.e.</i>, 25} This town which is now the capital of Dauphin
county was laid out twenty-three years ago by the late proprietor,
Mr. Harris, whose father is buried near the bank of
the river, opposite the stone house he lived in, under a large
old tree, which, once during his life, concealed and saved
him from some Indians, by whom he was pursued.</p>

<p>I observed in the office of a Mr. Downie, a magistrate,
a newly invented patent stove, made of sheet iron, consisting
of two horizontal parallel cylinders, about a foot
apart, one over the other and communicating by a pipe;
the upper one is heated by the smoke from the lower, which
contains the fuel. Mr. Downie informed me that it saved
much fuel. The patentee lives here.</p>

<p>On returning to my inn, I found there a Mr. W. P——, of
Pittsburgh, just arrived. In the course of the evening he
gave me much good information of the western country, accompanied
by a friendly invitation to call on him in Pittsburgh,
should I be detained there until his return from
Philadelphia, where he was now going. He had formerly
lived in Harrisburgh for some years after his arrival from
Ireland, his native country. The joyful eagerness with
which numbers of his old acquaintance flocked to Bennet’s
to visit him, evinced his having been much esteemed and
respected.</p>

<p>On Saturday 24th, I arose early, but the ferry-boat not
being ready, I partook of an excellent breakfast with my
friendly host and his family, and at ten o’clock I embarked
in a large flat, with the western mail and several passengers
and horses. The flat was worked by nine stout men, with
short setting poles shod and pointed with iron, to break the
ice and stick in the bottom. Only one set or pushed on the
upper side, while eight set on the lower side, to keep the
boat from being forced by the current against the ice, while
a tenth steered with a large oar behind. A channel for this
purpose had been cut through the ice, and was kept open
as loaded wagons could cross the river in a flat with more
safety than on the ice.</p>

<p>In twenty-two minutes we were landed on the western
shore of the Susquehannah in Cumberland county; and I
trudged on, my foot paining me very much, until half past
twelve o’clock, when I stopped at a tavern seven miles from
the ferry and got some refreshment. Here I found a tall
active old man of the name of Jameson, seventy-six years
of age, who had crossed the ferry with me, and had afterwards
passed me on the road, on horseback. He had
accompanied his parents from the county Antrim in Ireland
when only six years old, had resided thirty-six years at
Paxton, near where Harrisburgh has since been built, (where
he had been on business) and had afterwards removed to a
part of Virginia about two hundred miles distant, where he
has a large farm and distillery. He insisted on treating me,
as he said, he liked to encourage the consumption of whiskey;
of which, and the telling of old stories he was so fond,
that he appeared to forget he had so {27} long a journey before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>him, until reminded by seeing some travellers pass on horseback,
whom he hastened to overtake for the sake of their
company. He did not however neglect finishing his whiskey,
which he swallowed with great gout, and on mounting his
horse, cracked jokes about a buxom widow, at whose
tavern beyond Carlisle, he proposed sleeping that night.
Among other stories with which he had entertained me,
he told me the particulars of the massacre of the Indians
at Lancaster, and he took a good deal of pride to himself,
for having been one of the heroes who had assisted on that
memorably disgraceful expedition. In justice however to
the old man, I must observe that he related with pleasure
that the party he accompanied, arrived too late in Lancaster
to assist in the carnage.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>{28} As this is a circumstance not generally known, it may
not be amiss to introduce here a short account of it.—The
Conestoga Indians, as they were called, from their residence
near the banks of Conestoga creek, were the remains of a
tribe of the Six nations, who entered into a treaty with William
Penn the first proprietor of the then province of Pennsylvania,
towards the close of the seventeenth century, by
which they had a thousand acres of land assigned them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>the manor of Conestoga for their residence. This treaty
had been frequently renewed afterwards, and was never
violated on either part until their extermination by the surrounding
settlers. It is remarked that the Indians diminish
rapidly, in proportion to the increase of European settlers
in the neighbourhood of any of their towns. This was
very observable here, where from a tribe, they had decreased
in about seventy years, to seven men, five women, and eight
children.</p>

<p>An Indian war had commenced through the intrigues of
the French, in the year 1754, at the commencement of which,
many of the frontier inhabitants being murdered or driven
in by the aborigines, aided by the French, a general panick
followed. The Conestoga Indians, notwithstanding their
weakness, their local situation, and their peaceable and innocent
habits of supporting themselves by making of wicker
{29} baskets, brooms and other wooden ware, which they
sold to their white neighbours, as well as the skins of the
wild animals which they killed in hunting, became objects of
terror to the panick struck whites. To be an Indian, was
enough to excite both the passions of fear and revenge.
This poor defenceless remnant of a once powerful tribe, had
but just sent an address, according to their custom on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>occasion of every new governor, to John Penn, esq. who
then held that office; welcoming him on his arrival from
Britain, and praying a continuance of that favour and protection
they had hitherto experienced; when at the dawn
of day of the 14th December 1763, the Indian village was
attacked by about sixty men well mounted and armed.
Only three men, two women and a boy were found at home,
the rest being out among the whites vending their little
wares. Those poor wretches were butchered and scalped
in the manner of the savages, by those more savage descendants
of the civilized Europeans: Even the hoary locks of
the venerable and good old chief Shebaes, who had assisted
at the second treaty between the whites and Indians in
1701, and who had always since been the avowed friend of
the former, could not excite the mercy, much less the respect
of his barbarous assassins:—he was cut to pieces in his bed,
and scalped with the rest, and the huts were then committed
to the flames. The magistrates of Lancaster collected
the remaining Indians, and brought them into that
town, condoling with them on the late misfortune, and
promising them protection; with which intent they were put
into the jail, as the strongest building in the town.</p>

<p>Their merciless blood hounds not satiated with the blood
already spilt, and increased to the number of five hundred
well armed men, marched into Lancaster. No opposition
was made to them, though the first party which arrived did
not consist of {30} more than fifty, who without awaiting
any of the rest, forced the jail, dragged their victims into the
yard, and there immolated them, while clinging to their
knees, and supplicating mercy. In this manner they all,
men, women, and children, received the hatchet, amid the
exultations of their murderers, who after the tragedy, paraded
the streets, huzzaing, and using every other mark of self-approbation
for the glorious deed they had achieved. How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>weak must have been the government, which dared not attempt
any publick investigation of an act so disgraceful to
humanity, and in such direct violation of the laws; but it is
a fact that not even the name of one of the perpetrators was
ever published; they were however generally known by the
appellation of <i>Paxton boys</i>, though the township of Paxton
was only one of many concerned.</p>

<p>At the tavern where I overtook Jameson, I saw some young
men in blue jackets with scarlet binding, the uniform of a
volunteer corps of militia riflemen. They had been with
their rifles in search of squirrels, but unsuccessfully, the
weather being too cold for those animals to come out of
their hollow trees.</p>

<p>Apropos of the rifle.—The inhabitants of this country
in common with the Virginians, and all the back woods
people, Indians as well as whites, are wonderfully expert
in the use of it: thinking it a bad shot if they miss the very
head of a squirrel, or a wild turkey, on the top of the highest
forest tree with a single ball; though they generally load with
a few grains of swan shot, with which they are equally sure
of hitting the head of the bird or animal they fire at.</p>

<p>Ten miles further brought me to Carlisle,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at six o’clock
in the evening; the whole road from Harrisburgh {31} being
very fine and level, the houses and farms good, and the face
of the country pleasant. The view on the right is all the
way terminated by the Blue mountains—the longest north
eastern branch of the Allegheny ridge, from six to ten miles
distant.</p>

<p>I observed about a mile from Carlisle on the left, and
about a half a mile from the road, a large handsome stone
house belonging to a Mr. Jackson of Baltimore, which was
formerly owned by General Arden; and about half way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>between it and the town, and also to the left of the road, the
large barrack, magazine, and depot of arms, built during
the revolutionary war. Dickenson college, a spacious stone
building with a cupola was directly before me, with the
town of Carlisle on the left of it extending to the southward
on an elevated plain: the whole having a very good effect on
the approach. The twilight shutting out further view, I
hastened through a tolerable compact street to Foster’s, to
which I had been recommended as the best inn. I asked
if I could have a bed that night, and was answered
rudely, by an elderly man, in the bar who I took for the
landlord, after he had eyed me with a contemptuous
scrutiny—that I could not. The house appeared a little
<i>would be stylish</i>—and I was afoot—so not of consequence
enough for Mr. Foster. I turned on my heel, and
entered the next tavern kept by Michael Herr, an honest
and obliging German, where I found nothing to make me
regret my being rejected as a guest at Foster’s, except want
of bed linen, sheets not being generally used in this country
in the inns, excepting at English ones, or those of fashionable
resort. A very good bed otherwise, and an excellent supper,
with attentive treatment, well compensated for that little
deficiency.</p>

<p>After supper, I received both pleasure and information
from the conversation of a philosophick German gentleman,
an inhabitant of Carlisle, who favoured {32} me with
his company, and who discoursed fluently on opticks,
pneumaticks, the French modern philosophy, and a variety
of literary topicks, evincing great reading, and a good
memory.</p>

<p>Before I retired to rest, I walked to the tavern, where the
wagons generally stop, and had the pleasure of finding,
that arrived, which carried my baggage, which I had not
seen since I left Lancaster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>
<p>Carlisle is a post town, and the capital of Cumberland
county. It contains about three hundred houses of brick,
stone, and wood. The two principal streets cross each
other at right angles, where there is a market-house, a neat
brick court-house and a large stone meeting-house. There
are besides in the town, a German, an Episcopalian, and a
Roman Catholick church. The streets are wide, and the
footways are flagged or coarsely paved. Dickenson college
on the north, was founded in 1783, and was so named
in compliment to Mr. John Dickenson, formerly president
of the supreme executive council of Pennsylvania, and author
of the Pennsylvania Farmer’s Letters, and other writings of
much merit. It has a principal,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> three professors, and
generally about eighty students. It has a philosophical
apparatus and a library, containing about three thousand
volumes. It has £4000 in funded certificates, and the
state has granted it ten thousand acres of land: {33} On the
whole it is esteemed a respectable seminary of learning, and
is extremely well situated for that purpose, in a healthy
and plentiful country, and about equidistant from the capital
of the state, and the capital of the United States, one
hundred and twenty miles from each.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> The character here given of old Mr. Jameson, puts us in mind of an old man
of a similar character in Washington county, Pennsylvania, of the name of <i>Foreman</i>,
who at this time is <i>ninety-eight</i> years of age. I had a curiosity in seeing this
old gentleman, and about two years ago called on him for the purpose of conversing
a few minutes with him. I was fully paid the trouble, for I found him talkative
and considerably worldly minded. Among other things he observed that
‘The fashions of the day had injured society, and had lead astray the minds of
young men and young women from the paths of simple and rustick honesty they
used to walk in fifty or sixty years ago. That there was much hypocrisy in the
shew of so much religion as appeared at present. That people were too fond of
lying in their beds late in the morning, and drinking too much whiskey. That
he himself used to take a frolick now and then to treat his friends of a Saturday
night, after working hard all the week, but that he had not drank any spirituous
liquors for twenty-five years. That he had been always an early riser, having
been in the habit when he first settled where he now lives (having come from Virginia
about thirty years ago) of going around to all his neighbours before or about
day-light, to waken them up, and bid them <i>good morning</i>, and return home again
before his own family would be out of bed. I asked him why he never came to
Pittsburgh; he replied that he could ride there he supposed, but that he had no
business in that place, but that he should like to move to Kentucky or to the state
of Ohio, if he went any where. On speaking of his great age and the probable
number of years he might yet live, he seemed inclined to believe he would live at
least four years longer, (being then ninety-six) wishing as appeared to me, to make
out the round number of <i>one hundred years</i>. He is quite a small man, somewhat
emaciated, but erect in his carriage, can see tolerably well, and walks about the
house without a cane, milk and vegetables have been, through life, his principal
diet, and water his beverage. His present wife, being his second, is quite a smart
woman, and is about eighty-six years old. The old gentleman observed that he
had never to his recollection been sick, so as to have required the aid of a physician.’
Happy old man thought I, thou hast been happy, and art still so!—Peace
to the remainder of thy lengthened days!—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

Dickenson college was burnt down by accidental fire, February 3d, 1803, and rebuilt
in 1804. Doctor Nesbit, a Scotch gentleman of great learning, and much celebrated
for his application to his studies, and particularly for the uncommon retentiveness
of his memory, had been several years president of this college; he died
18th January, 1804. The Rev. Mr. Atwater, from Middlebury, Vermont, took
his place as principal at the last commencement, on Wednesday the 27th September,
1809, and from his known abilities and piety, we may safely calculate that the

and pine woods—Shippensburgh—Strasburgh—North
or Blue mountain—Horse valley and Skinner’s
tavern.</p>
</div>


<p>On the 25th January at 8 A.M. I left Carlisle, having
previously taken an egg beat up in a glass of wine. There
are two roads, one called the Mountrock road which goes
from the north end of the town, and the other called the Walnut-bottom
road, which leads from the south end. They
run parallel to each other about three miles apart. I took
the latter, which is the stage road, as the wagon with my
baggage was to go that way, though I was informed that
the first led through a better country. I found mile-stones
on the right hand all the way to Shippensburgh, placed at
the expence of the proprietors of the lands on this road, to
prove it shorter than the other, they having before been computed
at the equal length of twenty-one miles each; but
now this one is marked only nineteen. The first five miles
are through a very poor and stony country, thinly inhabited,
and covered, except on the cultivated parts of the few
miserable looking farms, with short, stunted, scrubby wood.
The next seven miles are through a better improved country,
and a better soil, with large farms {34} and good houses;
then there are three miles over the northern skirt of the South
mountain, through gloomy forests of tall pines, with here
and there a log cabin surrounded by a few acres of cleared
land, and abounding in children, pigs, and poultry. The
last four miles improve gradually to Shippensburgh.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock I stopt and breakfasted at a large tavern
on the right, seven miles from Carlisle, I got coffee, bread
and butter, eggs and excellent honey in the comb, for which
I was charged only nineteen cents. My landlord presented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>me one of the largest and finest apples I had ever seen: it
was the produce of his own orchard, where he had several
trees of the same species, raised by himself from the pippin,
and neither grafted nor budded. He had the manners of a
New Englandman, being desirous both of receiving and of
communicating information, but I soon gathered from him
that he was a native of that part of Pennsylvania, and of
English extraction. On my entrance he had laid down a
book, which taking up afterwards, I found to be a volume
of Robertson’s Charles V.</p>

<p>As I proceeded from hence, two very beautiful red foxes
playfully crossed the road about a hundred yards before me;
they then recrossed it, and seeing me, made up a hill to the
right with incredible swiftness, leaping with ease a Virginia
worm fence above six feet high.</p>

<p>At half past four I arrived at Shippensburgh, which was
laid out for a town, about fifty years ago, and named after
the first proprietor and settler, the father of judge Shippen
of Philadelphia.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It contains between 150 and 200 straggling
houses, in one street, nearly a mile in length: with
nothing else interesting to recommend it to notice. I stopt
at Raume’s, a German house about the middle of the town,
and apparently the best tavern in it. I bathed my feet in
cold water, and dressed the left one which was {35} much
blistered and very painful: Soon after which, my wagonner
Jordan, with three others in his company arriving, we all
sat down together, according to the custom of the country,
to a plentiful and good supper; after which, the wagonners
spread their mattresses and blankets round the stove in the
bar room, and I retired to a good bed, but without an upper
sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Monday, 26th January, at half past ten; I proceeded
towards Strasburgh, in preference to keeping the stage road
to the left through Chambersburgh,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as I shortened the
road eight miles in a distance of thirty-eight, to where the
two roads again met.</p>

<p>The country to Strasburgh, eleven miles, is well inhabited,
and the soil is tolerably good; and the Blue mountains are
full in front, extending to the right and left as far as the eye
can reach. Those mountains are not higher than the highlands
on Hudson river above New York, about 2500 feet
perpendicular from the plain below, from which they rise
abruptly, and the road is seen winding up their side to a
small gap near the top, which separates from the main
ridge a pyramidal knob, which, apparently higher {36} than
the ridge, seems to hang directly over Strasburgh. I met on
the road, two wagons with six horses each, from Zanesville
in the state of Ohio, going to Philadelphia for goods:—They
had been a month on the road. At two miles from
Strasburgh, I past a direction post on the left pointing to
Cummins’s mills, and at 1 o’clock I entered that town and
stopt at Bell’s, the last tavern on the left. As there was no
beer in the house, they had to send for it to Merkel’s, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>German house. And here it may not be amiss to observe
that the German taverns on these roads, are generally better
provided with both liquors and provisions, than the English
or Irish, but their manners are not the most agreeable, they
being very inattentive to any of the wants of a traveller,
except the providing his meals, and the bringing him what
liquor he calls for.</p>

<p>It is twelve years since Strasburgh was laid out. It contains
about fifty indifferent houses, and does not seem to be
thriving.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, I began to ascend the North or Blue
mountains, immediately from Strasburgh.—After ascending
about a mile, I stopped and rested at a hut, the only dwelling
on the passage over the mountain. Proceeding from hence,
I was overtaken a little higher up by a man driving before
him his horse loaded with a bag of wheat. We entered into
conversation, and he entertained me with his exploits, in
killing bears,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> wolves, racoons, and foxes, {37} which abound
on these mountains, as well as deer, wild turkeys, pheasants,
and squirrels. I stopped occasionally, to observe the view
behind me, which though a good deal impeded by the trees,
is nevertheless very extensive, over a woody country, terminated
by the long range of the South mountain, extending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>from the banks of the Susquehannah below Harrisburgh to
the S.W. as far as the eye can reach. Though extensive, it
is however an uninteresting prospect, as though I saw many
patches of cleared land, the town of Shippensburgh twelve
miles distant, and Strasburgh directly under me;—wood with
its (at this season) brown, sombre hue, is the prevailing
feature. After ascending a mile and a half from Strasburgh,
I came to the top of the mountain, and looked down on the
other side into a dark narrow romantick vale called Horse
valley, with the two Skinner’s good farms, still house and mill,
and Conodogwinnet {38} creek gliding through the middle
towards the N.E.; while the middle mountain, rose immediately
opposite me, from the other side of the valley, the
summit of it apparently not a mile distant from where I
stood, though in reality it is three miles, so much is the eye
deceived by the depth of the intermediate vale.</p>

<p>At 4 o’clock, I stopped at Skinner’s, where at my particular
request, I was gratified with hasty pudding or mush, as
it is called in this state, with plenty of good milk and apple
pye for supper. My host was born near Woodbridge in
Jersey, from whence his father had removed to this country
many years ago. There are now about twenty families
settled in the valley, which extends from the south end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>twelve miles above Skinner’s, to a gap in the Blue mountains
five miles below, through which the Conodogwinnet flows
from its source at the upper end of the valley, which it
waters in its whole length of seventeen miles, to join the
Susquehannah near Harrisburgh, forty miles distant.</p>

<p>One Wagstaff, formerly an English soldier, who had been
wounded and made a prisoner at the battle of Monmouth,
and now a farmer near Pittsburgh, and a lad returning
home to the same neighbourhood, after assisting to drive
a herd of a hundred and fifty hogs to Philadelphia, which
had employed him a month, put up here for the night, and I
was much amused with the anecdotes of the old soldier and
my host, who had also been a soldier on the patriotick side,
during the revolutionary war. They had been opposed
to each other in several battles, and reminded each other
of many incidents which happened at them. My landlord
was a politician, but his system of politicks and his
general ideas were completely original. Amongst other
topicks, Col. Burr’s present situation and intentions were
discussed, when our host gave it as his decided opinion,
that he had secured {39} the friendship and assistance of a
warlike and powerful nation of Indians, inhabiting a country
on the banks of the Missouri about 1500 miles in circumference,
where is the celebrated mountain of salt. That
they fought on horseback and were armed with short
Spanish caribines; and that with their aid he meant to
conquer Mexico, and erect an empire independent of both
Spaniards and Americans.</p>

<p>Mrs. Skinner was confined to her bed in an advanced
stage of a consumption: I recommended her inhaling the
steam of melted rosin and bees-wax, and wrote directions
for her accordingly. When I retired to rest, I had once
more the luxury of clean sheets and a good bed.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> In the New York Medical Repository, vol. 5, page 343-4, we find the following
curious facts concerning the mode of generation in the American bear.</p>

<p>“The singular departure from the common course of nature in the procreation
of the opossum and the shark, are already known; but the manner in which the
fœtus is matured by the female bear is not so generally understood. The following
information was given to Mr. Franklin, senator of the United States from North
Carolina, by the hunters. This animal hybernates, and, during the winter, retires
to hollow trees and caverns, but does not become torpid, or sink into the sleeping
state. Though found often in great numbers on the frontier settlements, and
frequently killed and eaten by the inhabitants, there has never been an instance
of a female killed in a pregnant condition, or big with young. The reason is, that
almost immediately after conception, the fœtus, while shapeless, and resembling
merely a small animated lump, is excluded from the womb. Thus born, and exposed
to the open air, it has no connection with the teat like the opossum, nor with
an egg like the shark. There is no trace of a placenta nor umbilical vessels.
The growth of this rudiment of a future bear is supposed to be promoted by licking;
and the saliva of the dam, or some other fluid from her mouth, appears to afford it
nourishment. In the course of time, and under such management, the limbs
and organs are evolved, the surface covered with hair, and the young cub at length
rendered capable of attending its parent. Thus far the inquiries of the hunters
have gone. The facts are so curious, that the subject is highly worthy of further
investigation. And when the entire history of the process of generation in this
animal shall be known, new light will be shed upon one of the most obscure parts
of physiology. It is to be hoped that gentlemen whose opportunities are favourable
to the prosecution of this inquiry, will furnish the learned world shortly with the
whole of these mysterious phenomena.”—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th January, I took leave of
my friendly host Skinner, and passing his brothers about a
mile distant, I was joined by another pedestrian traveller,
who had left Strasburgh that morning, and had stopped here
to rest previous to ascending the middle mountain. He
walked on stoutly, and I limped after him, my foot paining
me very much. He was a plain countryman from Downpatrick
in the north of Ireland, who had formerly {40} resided
near Carlisle, from whence he had removed to the western
part of the state, where his health having suffered through a
general debility, he had returned two hundred miles to his
former residence for medical aid, had remained there since
the fall under a course of medicine and diet, and his health
being now re-established, he was again going to the western
country.</p>

<p>When on the top of the middle mountain about two miles
from Skinner’s, our eyes were regaled with a charming birds-eye
view of some fine cultivated farms in Path valley just
below us, with the village of Fannetsburgh of thirty houses in
the midst, watered by a fine mill stream called the Conogocheaque
in its southerly course towards the Potomack.</p>

<p>The scenery here reminded me of some of the vales of
Switzerland, but appetite for breakfast urging me on towards
the village below, I did not bestow much time in contemplating
it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>I now proved that “hunger is a good sauce,” for I made
a hearty meal at M’Callum’s, spite of a dirty room, a sickly
woman, and bad tea, which last even when good, I disapprove
of, especially for breakfast, but having always had
coffee hitherto, without ordering it, I had neglected doing
so now, and I was too hungry and too scrupulous of giving
trouble to direct or await a change. This was the second
sickly landlady I had seen amongst these mountains, which
has impressed me with an idea, that the air is too keen and
trying for delicate constitutions.</p>

<p>When I returned into the bar room, from the breakfast
parlour, if a small dirty room with a bed in it deserves that
appellation, I found a traveller in it, who had two horses
at the door, the use of one of which he had offered to my
fellow pedestrian (who, as he carried provision in a knapsack,
had not breakfasted with me,) on condition of his
being at the expence of feeding him on the road. He was
{41} just declining the offer as I entered, so I embraced it
gladly, and the young man agreed to take me up as soon as
he should overtake me on the road, as he had to await his
brother who was to accompany him, and I expressed a
wish to walk before over the Tuscarora mountain, both to
enjoy the scenery, and to avoid the danger of riding over
it three miles, with the road in many parts like glass, from
the freezing of the snow after a partial thaw. I set off with
my former companion, who I had regaled with a gill of
whiskey, but as I occasionally stopped to admire the beauties
of nature in that mountainous and romantick district,
he not being equally struck with them, preferred making
the best of his way, so walked on before, and separated
from me without ceremony, which I was not sorry for,
as it left me more at liberty and leisure to proceed as I
pleased.</p>

<p>As I ascended, the views of the valley behind were very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>fine, through and over the large heavy pines which cover
the face of the mountain; but when near the top, the prospect
to the southward was really sublime, of the valley in its
whole length that way, finely cultivated and watered, bounded
by distant pyramidal mountains, isolated and unconnected
with either of the ridges divided by the valley in a
long vista, about two miles wide. From the summit of the
Tuscarora ridge, the view to the westward, though extensive,
was cheerless and gloomy, over a broken and mountainous
or rather hilly country, covered with forests, chiefly of the
dark and sombre pine, which would have rendered me
quite dispirited, if I had not anticipated a speedy journey
through it on horseback.</p>

<p>At the western foot of the mountain I stopped at Ramsey’s,
an innkeeper, farmer, saddler and distiller, who has a
fine farm, and a good house (I mean literally, but not as a
tavern)—It was noon, Mr. Ramsey with a stranger, seated
himself to dinner, while {42} his wife in the patriarchal mode,
very common in this country, attended table. I contented
myself with a tumbler of egg punch, which I had just swallowed,
as my horsemen rode past, calling out that they would
await me at the distillery, where I accordingly joined them,
drank a dram of new whiskey with the hospitable distiller,
mounted my mare, threw away my cudgel, and
trotted off briskly with my new companions.</p>

<p>The road was good, but the country broken, thinly inhabited
and poor; pine woods on each hand—a red gravelly
soil, and a wretched looking log hut at every two or three
miles with a few acres cleared round it, but the stumps, or
girdled trees still standing. We stopped to feed our horses
at one, about six miles from Ramsey’s, which was the residence
of an old man named Hull, who had removed here
from Lancaster a few years ago. The large fire, cleanliness,
and air of plenty, which I found within, was the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>enjoyed, from the contrast with the wretched appearance
without.</p>

<p>On remounting, my mare started, and a bag of rye and
corn for provender which was on the saddle under me,
falling off, I fell with it. One of my companions checked
his horse suddenly and threw himself off to assist me, and I
was under both horses’ feet for some seconds; but seizing
the forefeet of the horse from which I apprehended the greatest
danger, I pulled them towards me, threw him down, and
at the same time scrambling from under him, I providentially
escaped with only a slight bruise on my left leg, and a
rent in my pantaloons. My gun which was loaded, and
which I carried slung at my back, was thrown some distance
from me without injury.</p>

<p>We soon after overtook my late foot companion, who I
believe now regretted that he had not prevented my ride,
as he seemed a good deal fatigued. We advised him to
bargain for a ride with a packer with {43} two light horses,
who we had past a little way behind, and we pushed on to
a mountain called Sideling-hill, eight miles from Hull’s;
which we ascended a mile, and then put up for the night, at
a very good tavern, kept by Daniel Coyle, who also owns
a fine farm between the ridges of the mountain.</p>

<p>I got an excellent supper alone, my fellow travellers carrying
their provisions with them: I had also a good bed
with sheets, but the pain of my blistered foot, which had been
augmented by hanging from the saddle in riding, prevented
my closing my eyes to sleep until three o’clock, when as
exhausted nature was just beginning to induce a temporary
oblivion of pain, James Wilson the oldest of my fellow
travellers called us to horse, as he said, we must this day
make a journey of upwards of forty miles. His brother
William, who like myself had never travelled that road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>before, was obliged to acquiesce, though unwillingly, so
rather than lose my horse I complied also, and we were on
the road in half an hour after.</p>

<p>After riding four miles on a continued ridge of Sideling-hill,
we stopped at a log tavern to pick up the old soldier
Wagstaff, whose stories had amused me so much at Skinner’s
in Horse valley, and who was a neighbour of Wilson’s.
He had the hog-driving lad still with him, and one horse
between them which they rode alternately.</p>

<p>It was not yet day, and the scene in the tavern was, to me,
truly novel. It was a large half finished log house, with no
apparent accommodation for any traveller who had not
his own bed or blanket. It was surrounded on the outside
by wagons and horses, and inside, the whole floor was so
filled with people sleeping, wrapped in their blankets round
a large fire, that there was no such thing as approaching it
to get warm, until some of the travellers who had awoke at
our entrance, went out to feed their horses, after doing which,
they returned, drank whiskey under {44} the name of bitters,
and resumed their beds on the floor—singing, laughing,
joking, romping, and apparently as happy as possible. So
much for custom.</p>

<p>About four miles from hence, we descended the western
side of Sideling-hill mountains, here called Rays-hill, at the
foot of which we forded the river Juniata, a beautiful
stream, about sixty yards wide, which after meandering in a
wonderful manner through this mountainous part of the
country upwards of 200 miles, through a space of not more
than 100 of a direct line, falls into the Susquehannah about
twenty miles above Harrisburgh; in all which distance it is
navigable for large flat boats, of which considerable numbers
are employed transporting the abundant produce of
those remote regions to the Susquehannah, and down that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>river to Baltimore, from whence it finds its way to Europe,
destined to assist in feeding those countries, which gave
birth to the ancestors of the cultivators of this.</p>

<p>After crossing the Juniata, we pursued our road through
a broken country, very hilly, with the river almost always in
sight, sometimes on one hand and sometimes on the other, as
its bends approached or receded from the road, and sometimes
directly under us at the foot of terrifick precipices, down
one of which, about twenty years ago, a wagon was carried
by the horses, falling 3 or 400 feet perpendicular—The
wagonner and horses were killed, and the wagon was dashed
to pieces.</p>

<p>At three miles and a half from the ford, we stopped to
feed our horses at a small log tavern, where was a large
family, with three or four very pretty girls, who forfeited
the admiration they would otherwise have commanded, by
being covered with the itch, which made me cautious how
I ordered any thing to eat or drink, although I could have
done justice to a good breakfast.</p>

<p>The same kind of country continues to Bedford, {45} the
road leading through two remarkable defiles between the
mountains, which as well as the river sometimes approach
and sometimes recede, the country gradually improving
both in population and quality of soil as we advanced.</p>

<p>At three miles from where we fed our horses, we passed
through a village of a dozen houses, called Bloody run, in
memory of a massacre by the Indians of about 250 militia,
while escorting a convoy of provisions to the western frontier,
soon after Braddock’s defeat near Pittsburgh.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Three miles further, we passed a hamlet of three or four
houses, called Snake-spring, from an immense number of
snakes discovered there in a hole and killed: And in four
miles more, at 11 o’clock, we entered Bedford, crossing two
bridges half a mile from the town, one over Crooked creek,
and the other over the west or Raystown branch, which
uniting a little below, form the Juniata.</p>

<p>We put up at Fleming’s and fed the horses while I breakfasted.
When ready to proceed, I mounted, but found my
mare so lame, that I was obliged to remain behind, while
my companions endeavoured to get her along by driving
her before them.</p>

<p>Making a virtue of necessity, I consoled myself under
my disappointment, by restoring to my constitution the
equilibrium of rest, which it was deprived {46} of last night,
by the anguish of my foot, and the impatience of the elder
Wilson; I accordingly went to bed, and enjoyed an hour’s
refreshing repose, after which I arose and sauntered about
the house until supper was announced, which I partook of
with my civil and attentive host and hostess Mr. and Mrs.
Fleming.</p>

<p>Soon after supper, five travellers from the N. W. part of
the state, arrived on horseback, with whom I conversed
until bed time. They were on their way to Baltimore, and
were plain Irishmen, uninformed of any thing beyond their
own business, which appeared to be that of packers, or
travelling merchants, who vend groceries and various merchandize
through the country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>
<p>The travelling on these roads in every direction is truly
astonishing, even at this inclement season, but in the spring
and fall, I am informed that it is beyond all conception.</p>

<p>Apropos of travelling—A European, who had not experienced
it, could form no proper idea of the manner of it
in this country. The travellers are, wagonners, carrying
produce to, and bringing back foreign goods from the different
shipping ports on the shores of the Atlantick, particularly
Philadelphia and Baltimore;—Packers with from one
to twenty horses, selling or trucking their wares through the
country;—Countrymen, sometimes alone, sometimes in
large companies, carrying salt from M’Connelstown, and
other points of navigation on the Potomack and Susquehannah,
for the curing of their beef, pork, venison, &amp;c.;—Families
removing further back into the country, some with
cows, oxen, horses, sheep, and hogs, and all their farming
implements and domestick utensils, and some without; some
with wagons, some with carts and some on foot, according
to their abilities:—The residue, who made use of the best
accommodations on the roads, are country merchants, {47}
judges and lawyers attending the courts, members of the
legislature, and the better class of settlers removing back.
All the first four descriptions carry provisions for themselves
and horses, live most miserably, and wrapped in blankets,
occupy the floor of the bar rooms of the taverns where they
stop each night, which the landlords give them the use of,
with as much wood as they choose to burn, in consideration
of the money they pay them for whiskey, of which they
drink great quantities, expending foolishly, for that which
poisons them, as much money as would render them comfortable
otherwise.—So far do they carry this mania for
whiskey, that to procure it, they in the most niggardly manner
deny themselves even the necessaries of life; and, as I was
informed by my landlord Fleming, an observing and rational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>man, countrymen while attending the courts (for they are
generally involved in litigation, of which they are very fond)
occupy the bar rooms of the taverns in the country towns,
for several days together, making one meal serve them each
day, and sometimes two, and even three days—but drinking
whiskey without bounds during the same time. The
latter description of travellers—the merchants, lawyers,
&amp;c. travel as in other countries—making use of and paying
for their regular meals, beds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The pain of my foot having been much alleviated, by an
application of bran and vinegar all night, the next morning
after my arrival in Bedford, I walked out into the town, and
having occasion to call at some tradesmen’s shops, and at another
excellent tavern where the stage from the eastward
stops, as that from the westward does at Fleming’s, I was
much gratified with the civility and desire to please, which
I observed throughout, which impressed me much in
favour of the place, and the impression was heightened
by another circumstance that forenoon. I had sat down
to write, and while engaged at it, the bar {48} keeper,
who had been amusing himself with an octave flute, of which
I had made a pocket companion, opened the door, and introduced
a gentleman of the middle age, who I supposed to
be a traveller; but he soon undeceived me, by telling me that
he had been informed I was fond of musick, and that I had
a German flute with me, which was also his instrument,
and he had taken the liberty of calling on me to inform me,
that there was a musical society in Bedford, of which he was
a member, and that he would convene it that evening for my
amusement, if I would assist them by taking a part. I excused
myself on account of the pain of my foot, and also on
my flute being an octave. He then hoped a glass of punch
would be acceptable, which I declined, saying, I never
drank spirits of any description. There was something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>perhaps ungracious in my refusal of his proffered civilities,
for he appeared hurt, and made a movement to depart, but
I made my peace, and prevailed on him to give me half an
hour of his company, by observing that although I was a bad
fellow with respect to the bottle, I nevertheless enjoyed very
much the society of the well bred and well informed, and
felt myself much obliged to him for his polite attention. He
proved to be a man of good theoretick information, but with
little practical worldly knowledge. From a desire to appear
to merit the compliment I had paid him, he was particularly
studious of his language, measuring each word, and weighing
every sentence before he gave it utterance;—prefacing
each speech with “If I may be permitted to hazard an
opinion,”—“According to my local ideas,” and other
set phrases to fill up the vacuum, while considering what he
should next say on the subject under discussion. We talked
of the country—of robberies—murders and accidents, and
at last he bade me good morning; setting me down, no
doubt, as a poor devil without soul, who would {49} not
drink spirits. On his taking leave, “my name, Sir, said he
is S—— it would perhaps be an unwarrantable liberty to
ask yours,” “Not at all, Sir, mine is ——.” Mrs. Fleming
afterwards told me that he was one of the associate judges
of the county, “a very clever and fine spoken man,” but
rather over fond of the universal enemy;—that he had
lost considerable property, but that his wife’s fortune being
secured to herself, enabled him to still enjoy some of the
comforts of life.</p>

<p>This afternoon my wagonner arrived, and went on, appointing
to be in Pittsburgh on the Friday or Saturday evening
of next week.</p>

<p>Bedford the capital of a county of the same name, is very
romantically situated—being hemmed in on all sides by
low mountains covered with woods except on the north,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>towards which point is a long vista, so that it has not unaptly
been compared to a barber’s bason, with the rim cut out
on one side for the chin. It was considered as a frontier
only about twenty years ago; when some of the stoccado
which had defended it when it had a garrison, was still to
be seen.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It now contains about 80 houses, of brick, stone
and logs. It has a court-house, a gaol, and school-house,
and I was informed that a house is used as a place of worship
for any Christian sect, and that sometimes a travelling
minister of one or other of the various divisions into which,
to its disgrace, Christianity is split, stops to remind the inhabitants
of their religious duties.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>{50} Apropos of religion.—Asking for a book last night,
my landlord sent me Richard Brother’s prophecies, with
which farrago of enthusiastick madness, I read myself to
sleep. The town is supplied with water from a spring half
a mile distant, by means of wooden pipes, which conduct it to
a reservoir in the centre: And some chalybeate springs
strongly impregnated with sulphur, have lately been discovered
in the neighbourhood; to which, according to
custom, whether with justice or otherwise, great medicinal
virtues are attributed.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This town was incorporated in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>1794, and is governed by two burgesses, a constable, a
town clerk and three assistants.</p>

<p>{51} The 31st day of January at 4 in the morning, I left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>Bedford in the stage with three gentlemen and a young
girl passengers. It had snowed all night, {52} and the
ground was covered some inches deep, so we had to proceed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>slowly to break the road, crossing the West branch of the
Juniata twice in the first three miles. As day dawned, the
country appeared to be in general rather better settled and
cultivated than on the eastern side of Bedford, but it was
still very hilly, and wood was the prevailing feature. At
half past 10, we had reached the foot of the Allegheny
{53} ridge, where we breakfasted; and here I found one of
the advantages of travelling in the stage, was to be charged
a sixteenth of a dollar more per meal, than if one travelled
in any other way.</p>

<p>We were now in Somerset county, and having changed
stages, horses, and drivers, we ascended by a very easy
road of one mile to the top of the highest ridge of land in
the United States, to the eastward of which all the rivers
flow to the eastward, to empty themselves into the Atlantick
ocean, while to the westward, they flow westerly to unite
with the Mississippi, which is their common aqueduct to the
gulph of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The face of the country before us now changed for the
better; not being broken as to the eastward, but fine extensive
levels and slopes, well inhabited and cultivated; and
the ridges of hills, though long, not so steep, and finely
clothed with heavy wood. This was the general appearance
of the country, until we arrived at Somerset, the capital
of the county, 14 miles from the top of the Allegheny
ridge.</p>

<p>This is a new town, having been laid out and built within
twenty years: It contains about seventy tolerably good
houses, with a court-house, where upstairs, is the present
place of worship, common to all sects like Bedford, until a
church, which is to be in common also, is erected, for which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>the town has petitioned the assembly to enable them to
raise $3000 by lottery.</p>

<p>We stopped at Webster’s excellent, comfortable, and well
furnished inn, where we found good fires, a good supper,
and a series of the Baltimore Daily Advertiser.</p>

<p>Since I had come over the three mountains between
Strasburgh and Ramsay’s, the principal subject of conversation
along the road, was concerning the murder by two
Frenchmen of a Mr. David Pollock, on the 23d of this
month, on Allegheny mountain. {54} They had shot him,
and when he fell in consequence from his horse, they dragged
him off the road into the wood, and stabbed him with a
knife in several places. He was soon after discovered dead
by a company of packers, who had seen two men but a
little while before, and had heard soon after, the reports of
a double barrelled gun carried by one of them. This, and
the meeting of a horse with a saddle and saddle-bags, and
no rider, gave them a suspicion, and induced them to search
in the wood, following the tracks of men from the road into
the wood, to the body. After returning to the road they
again saw the two men whom they suspected come out of the
woods before them. They pursued them, but lost sight
of them at a turning in the road, where they again took into
the woods. The packers rode on to the next house and
gave an alarm, which soon mustered the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood, who arming themselves, went in pursuit
of the murderers. One of them resisting, when discovered,
was shot, and the other apprehended, and lodged in Somerset
gaol.</p>

<p>I had been informed that the prisoner neither spoke, nor
understood English, and that since his apprehension, he
had no interpreter with him, except a German farmer, who
understood French but badly. Impelled by humanity, I
asked my landlord to accompany me to visit him. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>a poor, ignorant, abject, pusillanimous wretch of the name
of Noel Hugue, and had lately arrived in America from
Marseilles, where he had been a traiteur or cook. He
denied the murder or any knowledge of it, but his story was
inconsistent and dissatisfactory. On my informing him of
the motives of my visit, he was very grateful. I advised
him to write to any persons at New York or Philadelphia,
where he had staid some time after his arrival, who might
have it in their power to send him any testimonial of character;
{55} and, as I thought his case desperate, to write to his
friends or connections in France, and that the court before
which he would be tried, or whatever lawyer was charged
with his defence, would forward his letters. On my return
to the inn a Mr. Leiper, a young gentleman just called to the
bar, requested me to accompany him to the gaol, to interpret
between him and the prisoner, as he intended voluntarily
to undertake his defence, although it was so unpopular
as not to be unattended with personal danger, in the irritated
state of mind of the country. I complied with his request,
but from the interview, I had no reason to expect his humane
attempt would be, or ought to be successful.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> It is perhaps worth while for the sake of a curious and important fact, to mention
the extraordinary effects of the water on a gentleman who had visited this
spring in the summer of 1809, and who before he left it, discharged from his bowels
a <i>living monster</i>, described by some who saw it, as a <i>lizard</i>, by others a <i>crab</i>, with
legs, claws, &amp;c. and of considerable size.—The unhappy man had been ill for
several years, without being able to get any relief by the aid of skilful physicians.
Immediately after this, he began to recover, and is now in a fair way of regaining his
health.</p>

<p>Of the four classes of mineral waters known, the water of this spring unites the
qualities of at least <i>three</i> of them, viz. The <i>saline</i>, the <i>sulphurous</i>, and the <i>martial</i>—but
of the second it is lightly tinctured. Its usual effects on people in health, are
those of an immediate and powerful <i>diuretick</i>, a gentle <i>cathartick</i>, with a considerable
increase of <i>perspiration</i>, and sometimes a slight <i>emetick</i>, this last happening but
very seldom. The water may be drank in great quantities with safety, from two to
thirty half pints, being the usual quantity in the course of an hour before breakfast.
Some indeed drink fifty half pints, while others are considerably incommoded by
drinking a gill, which was the case with Mrs. Snyder, wife of governor Snyder,
whose death was lately announced. She was at the spring, August 1809, but her
case, which was of the consumptive kind, was too far gone to admit of recovery. Not
being able to take the water, she tarried but a few days, and returned to Lancaster
with her companion, Miss ——</p>

<p class="center"><i>To John Anderson, M. D. the following Verses are inscribed, as a token of Friendship,
by the Author James Ross</i></p>

<p class="center">ON THE MEDICINAL SPRING OF BEDFORD</p>

<p>From the base of a lofty mountain issuing, O fountain, thy profusion of waters,
thou sendest forth in silence, from thy fountain, deep in earth’s womb embowled,
them mingling with the stream, which murmurs below, thou loosest. No verdant
plains, nor verdant fields are nourished by thy stream irriguous. Nor flocks, nor
younglings of the herd dost thou with food supply. To no prowling beasts of
prey, do thy shady, thy romantick banks, afford shelter or refuge. <i>Hence</i>, blooming
virgins gay, matrons old, and aged sires, and youths lately in wedlock joined:
greatly delight to saunter along thy streams; <i>and, in the cool refreshing shade</i>, to
quaff thy healing waters.</p>

<p>While, with heartfelt satisfaction, the valetudinarian, in the waters of this fountain,
laves himself, the diseases of the breast—the pains of the head—the distresses
of the side—and deafness, <i>which prevents the ear from drinking in the rich
melodies of musick</i>, all shrink from the healing efficacy of the healthful element.
Let those drink whom the gout torments, and those whom the distressing cough
annoys, diseases, which yield not to the art or care of the physician, however learned.
In drinking, they certain aid shall find. The humble cottager, and wealthy lord,
however weakened by disease shall re-invigorate their systems, by drinking these
waters. Tender eyes shall regain their strength—lost powers of digestion shall
again return—and the enfeebled loins, with new strength be girded. Let the
sons of leisure, and votaries of amusement, on these health preserving waters regale
themselves. The vigorous young man, and the rosy cheeked, from them receives
no harm. Rich and poor innumerous, can well attest the truths I sing.</p>

</div>


<p>The 1st February at 4 A. M. I left Somerset in a sleigh, a
good deal of snow having fallen the day before. One of
the gentlemen and the little girl having quitted the stage,
my companions now were only a Mr. M’Kinley, of West
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>Liberty near Wheeling in Virginia, one of the representatives
in the state assembly, returning home from Richmond, and
a Mr. Archer of Centreville in Ohio, returning home also,
from a circuitous voyage and journey to New Orleans {56}
and Baltimore; during which he had visited the Havanna,
and New Providence in the Bahamas.—As we all possessed
some information different from each other, we beguiled
our journey by conversation pleasantly enough, except
when politicks were introduced, on which, my fellow travellers
being of opposite sentiments, I was sometimes under the
necessity of starting some new subject, to prevent their being
wrought up to an irritation of temper, which not only prevented
cool argument, but sometimes in spite of my endeavours
to the contrary, arose to such a height as to nearly
approach to personalities.</p>

<p>Politicks, throughout the whole of this country, seems to
be the most irritable subject which can be discussed. There
are two ruling or prevailing parties; one, which styles itself
<i>Federal</i>, founded originally on the federal league or constitution
which binds the states to each other; in contradistinction
to a party which attempted to prevent the concurrence
of the states to the present constitution, and after
it was agreed to, made some fruitless attempts to disorganize
it, and was called <i>Antifederal</i>. The opposite party
is one which has since sprung up and styles itself the Democratick
Republican. Since the federal constitution has
been established, the first party exists no longer except <i>in
name</i>. <i>That</i> which assumes it, stickles for the offices of
government being executed with a high hand, and is therefore
accused of aristocratick and even of monarchick sentiments
by its opponents, who in their turn are termed factious,
and disorganizers, by the federalists. They nickname
each other <i>Aristocrats</i> and <i>Democrats</i>, and it is astonishing
to what a height their mutual animosity is carried. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>are not content with declaiming against each other in congress,
or in the state legislatures, but they introduce the
subject even at the bars of the judicial courts, and in the
pulpits of the places of religious worship. In some places,
{57} the males who might otherwise be on terms of friendship
with each other, are, merely on account of their diversity
of sentiment on politicks, avowed and illiberal enemies;
and the females carry the spirit of party into their coteries,
so far as to exclude every female whose husband is of a
different political opinion, however amiable, and ornamental
to society she may be. The most illiberal opinions are
adopted by each party, and it is sufficient with a federalist
that another man is a republican, to pronounce him capable
of every crime; while the republican takes care not to allow
the federalist the smallest of the attributes of virtue.—Their
<i>general</i> difference of opinion, at last becomes <i>particular</i>, and
a mistaken point of honour frequently hurries the one or the
other maniack into a premature grave.—The political wheel
is kept in constant motion by those two parties, who monopolize
it to themselves, to the exclusion of the moderate, well
disposed, and best informed part of the community; who
quietly pursue their several avocations, lamenting at, yet
amused by the bickerings, disputes and quarrels of the
turbulent and ambitious leaders of the parties, and their
ignorant, prejudiced and obstinate tools—satisfied with
the unexampled prosperity they enjoy as a people and a
nation—and equally watchful perhaps to guard against
tyranny or licentiousness, with the violent and avowed opponents
of both.</p>

<p>After travelling seven miles through the glades, a rather
barren and thinly settled plain, we crossed a bridge over
Laurel hill creek, a mile beyond which we began to ascend
Laurel hill, which we continued to do two miles further to
Evart’s tavern, where we breakfasted. Six miles more,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>brought us to the beginning of the descent westerly, there
being several settlements on each side the road between the
ridges of the mountain in that distance. From this point we
had an extensive view as far west as the eye could {58} reach,
over and beyond Chesnut hills. After descending two
miles, we crossed Indian creek at the foot of the mountain. I
now remarked that the woods were much thicker, and the
trees larger and taller, than the same species to the eastward.
A mile from Indian creek, Mr. M’Kinley pointed
out one of the finest farms between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh,
owned by one M’Mullen, an Irishman.</p>

<p>At 10 A. M. we changed horses and our sleigh for a stage wagon,
two miles from M’Mullen’s, at M’Ginnis’s, perhaps
the dirtiest tavern on the whole road. We then continued
ten miles over a very broken hilly country, with rich valleys,
crossing a high ridge called Chesnut hills, from whence
the western country is spread out under the view, like an
immense forest, appearing flat from the height we were
at, though it is in fact, as we found it, very hilly. We
crossed the river Sewickly, a fine mill stream, by a bridge,
ten miles from M’Ginnis’s, and eight miles further we arrived
at Greensburgh, the capital of Westmoreland county,
which we had entered at the eastern foot of Laurel hill.</p>

<p>Greensburgh is a compact, well built, snug little town,
of about a hundred houses, with a handsome court-house, a
Presbyterian meeting-house, and a market-house.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>On entering Habach’s tavern, I was no little surprised to
see a fine coal fire, and I was informed that coal is the principal
fuel of the country fifty or sixty miles round Pittsburgh.
It is laid down at the doors here for six cents a bushel.</p>

<p>After supper we were joined by a Mr. Holly, a doctor,
and another gentleman, residents of the town, according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>to the custom of the country, where the inhabitants are in
habits of collecting what information they can from travellers.
We had a long political discussion, originating on the
subject of Col. Burr’s projects; and amongst the six present,
there {59} were no two who agreed in sentiment. Indeed, in
this country every man thinks for himself, or at least he
imagines he does, and would suppose himself insulted, was
another to attempt <i>openly</i> to bias his opinion; but notwithstanding
this supposed liberty of sentiment, superior talents
when united to ambition, seldom fail of drawing the mass
after them. The conversation of this evening was both
amusing and instructive; some of the party, particularly Mr.
Holly, a New England man, being possessed of very good
information, and the arguments were conducted with cool,
dispassionate reasoning.</p>

<p>About 8 o’clock, the landlord, who was a German, came
into the room and offered to light us to bed: My fellow
travellers complied, but I told him I should sit up two hours
longer. The old man repeated my words, “two hours,”
shrugged up his shoulders and went off, while I literally
kept my word, amused by a series of three or four of the
last Baltimore Federal Gazettes. On going to bed, and
finding the bed clothes very light, I added the covering of
another bed in the room to mine, which I left so in the morning
as a hint to the house.</p>

<p>At five o’clock next morning, we resumed our journey,
and found very little snow on the road, though there was so
much on the mountains behind us.</p>

<p>The aspect of the country is similar to what it is between
the Laurel hills and Greensburgh. Hills running in ridges
from north to south, heavily wooded with white oak, walnut,
sugar tree and other timber natural to the climate; and the
valleys narrow, but rich and all settled.</p>

<p>At eight miles from Greensburgh, we passed on our right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>an excellent house and fine farm of a Col. Irwin, one of the
assistant judges; and three miles further we stopped to
change horses and breakfast at {60} Stewart’s, where we
were charged only a quarter of a dollar each.</p>

<p>We soon after entered Allegheny county. The weather
was cold and clear, and very pleasant for the season, but
the country afforded no variety, being still, hill, dale, woods,
and scattering farms. At nine miles from Stewart’s, we
descended a very long and steep hill, by a shocking road,
crossed Turtle creek at the bottom, which runs to the southward
to join the river Monongahela, 12 miles above its
confluence with the Allegheny; we then ascended another
hill by an equally bad and dangerous road. It is astonishing
that in so fine and so improving a country more attention
is not paid to the roads. A turnpike is projected from
Pittsburgh to Harrisburgh, which I am clearly of opinion,
might be kept in repair by a reasonable toll;—and then
wagons with goods may travel between the two places in a
third less time than they do now, and without the present
great risks of breaking down, and the mails may be delivered
at the post-offices one half sooner.</p>

<p>When about seven miles from Pittsburgh, we had a picturesque
view of the Monongahela on the left, which was
soon hid again by the intervening hills; and when within
three miles of that town, the view was beautiful over the
fine low cultivated level, or bottom, as it is called, which
skirts the river Allegheny from thence to Pittsburgh, which
is seen at the confluence of that river with the Monongahela;
beyond which, the high and steep coal hill crowned by a
farm house most romantically situated, seems to impend
directly over the glass manufactury, on the bank of the
river opposite the town.</p>

<p>The last two miles was along the fine level above mentioned,
passing on the right, between the road and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>Allegheny, the handsome seat of Mr. John Woods, a respectable
lawyer;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and immediately after, {61} we passed
Fort Fayette, a stockaded post on the right<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—entered
Pittsburgh, and put up at Wm. M’Cullough’s excellent inn.</p>

<p>The appearance of Pittsburgh in the winter, is by no
means pleasing, notwithstanding its fine situation, as, none
of the streets being paved except Market street,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> they are
so extremely miry, that it is impossible to walk them without
wading over the ankle, except during frosty weather, which
rarely continues many days successively, from its lying so
low, and being so well sheltered, by the surrounding hills.
This, though unpleasant now, is in reality in favour of the
place, as when the streets are all paved, that inconvenience
will be obviated, and the advantage of shelter from the
bleak wintry winds will still remain, without its being followed
by an exclusion of fresh air during the summer, as the
rivers, at that season act as ventilators, a refreshing breeze
always drawing up or down one of them, increasing {62}
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>with the elevation of the sun until noon, and then gradually
subsiding into a calm towards sunset; while at a little distance
from those air conductors (the rivers) even in high
situations, an oppressive heat not rarified by the most gentle
zephyr, prevails during the same time.</p>

<p>Another cause of the unprepossessing appearance of
Pittsburgh, proceeds from the effect of one of the most useful
conveniences and necessaries of life, which it enjoys in a
pre-eminent degree; namely, fuel, consisting of as fine coal
as any in the world, in such plenty, so easily wrought, and
so near the town, that it is delivered in wagons drawn by
four horses, at the doors of the inhabitants, at the rate of
five cents per bushel.</p>

<p>A load of forty bushels which costs only two dollars, will
keep two fires in a house a month, and in consequence,
there are few houses, even amongst the poorest of the inhabitants,
where at least two fires are not used—one for cooking,
and another for the family to sit at. This great consumption
of a coal abounding in sulphur, and its smoke
condensing into a vast quantity of lampblack, gives the
outside of the houses a dirty and disagreeable appearance—even
more so than in the most populous towns of Great
Britain, where a proportionably great quantity of coal is
used; which must be caused by a difference of quality, which
appears in the grate to be in favour of the coal of this country.</p>

<p>The winter being too far advanced for boats to descend
the Ohio, I preferred remaining in Pittsburgh, until I should
have an opportunity of continuing my journey to the westward
by water, to going on immediately by land, as I wished
to see the banks of that celebrated river, as far as it lay in my
route.</p>

<p>I therefore became a weekly boarder and lodger at M’Cullough’s,
which though an inn much frequented by travellers,
I found to be as quiet, as regular, {63} and as orderly, as any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>private lodging house; the beds equally cleanly, the table
more plentiful, and the charge as moderate. As M’Cullough
lays himself out to accommodate travellers, or regular
lodgers, he applies himself solely to that, and discourages
every thing which might subject his house to the noise,
revelry, and confusion of a tavern. His wife an amiable
and obliging woman, and three daughters, fine and good
girls just grown up, attend to the business of the house, and
the accommodation of their guests, so well, that a man must
be fastidious to a fault, who would not be perfectly satisfied
with such quarters.</p>

<p>The streets being extremely dirty, and my foot still paining
me much from the consequence of its being blistered on my
journey between Lancaster and Middleton, I confined myself
to the house for several days after my arrival, going out
only once during that time, to call on general O’Hara<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and
Mr. Abner Barker on business. Confinement is at any
time unpleasant; but at an inn, however good the accommodation,
in a strange place, without a single acquaintance,
and suffering continued torture from an inflammation in a
limb, the pain of which would have prevented my enjoying
a book, even had there been a library within my reach, was
to me excessively so.</p>

<p>A few neighbouring gentlemen hearing that a stranger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>was at M’Cullough’s confined by indisposition, did me the
favour of calling on me, and the attentions of doctor Andrew
Richardson, Mr. James Mountain, a learned practitioner at
the bar, and Messrs. Anthony Beelen and Nicholas Cunningham
respectable merchants, prevented my being able
to charge Pittsburgh with an <i>absolute</i> want of hospitality.
The two former offered me the use of their judiciously
selected libraries, when I should become sufficiently convalescent
to go out, and the perusal of any of their books in
the interim, and the first supplied {64} me with the Philadelphia
and Baltimore newspapers as they arrived by post, twice
weekly.</p>

<p>A few evenings after my arrival, the daughters of my host
had a numerous party of young people of both sexes to
spend the evening and practice vocal musick under the
directions of a Mr. Tyler who had taught them. They
displayed taste and harmony enough to do honour to their
venerable teacher, and I was tempted to join the sounds of
my flute to the sweet treble of some of the young ladies.
This led to a degree of confidence to me from Mr. Tyler,
who on retiring to bed in the same room, imparted to me
his little history, which though not replete with incident,
was singular and affecting, exhibiting generous benevolent
simplicity, a victim to vice and ingratitude. He was an
Englishman, and had been one of the choristers of a cathedral
in England from whence he had emigrated to America,
when a young man. He had exercised his talent in teaching
sacred musick, in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, until
he had acquired a sufficiency to purchase a farm in the
neighbourhood of Carlisle, where he and his wife settled.
They were childless—an infant foundling which they
chanced to see, impressed them with the idea of supplying
themselves with what nature had denied them. They took
the boy home, adopted him as their son, and spared neither
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>pains nor expence to give him the best education the country
afforded. He grew up a most promising youth, and bid
fair to reward them for their parental cares, by smoothing
their decline of life, with a return of those attentions which
they had lavished on him from his helpless childhood. The
lad was a good accomptant, and was placed with a storekeeper
in Carlisle, until he was supposed by his benefactors
sufficiently versed in business, to manage for himself.
Tyler then expended the savings of many years industry to
furnish for him a respectable country store. The young
{65} man commenced business with the fairest prospects, but
he had unfortunately contracted habits of drinking and
gambling. His business was neglected, one loss followed
another, but he had the art of still imposing on the unsuspecting
simplicity of his blindly partial and generous patron,
until he prevailed on him to be his security for larger sums
than his remaining stock of goods would pay. He then
absconded, his creditors sued the old man, who to save
himself from prison was obliged to dispose of his farm, and
after paying the debts of the ungrateful prodigal, with the
very small sum which remained to him, he and his wife last
year at upwards of sixty years of age each, crossed the
mountains, at an inclement season, and purchased a small
tract of land about seven miles from Pittsburgh, on which
he has since erected a cottage, and where he has cleared and
cultivated a few acres, and to enable himself to make his
payments, he has taught sacred vocal musick in this town
and the surrounding country these two successive winters.
His enthusiasm for vocal harmony, and his innocent unsuspecting
simplicity, untainted during a long life, by worldly
craft, and still believing the mass of mankind as honest and
virtuous as himself, notwithstanding the trying proof he
had experienced of its baseness, rendered him a singular
and original character; I say <i>original</i>, for I much question,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>whether any person into whose hands these sheets may fall,
can turn his eye inwardly, and exclaim with a conscience
void of offence and selfishness, I too am a general philanthropist,
like the good old English singing master.</p>

<p>Several musical amateurs are associated here under the
title of the <i>Apollonian Society</i>. I visited it by invitation at
the house of Mr. F. Amelung the acting President, and was
most agreeably surprised to hear a concert of instrumental
musick performed by about a dozen gentlemen of the town,
with a degree {66} of taste and execution, which I could not
have expected in so remote a place. I was particularly astonished
at the performance on the violin of Mr. Gabler,
a German, employed at Gen. O’Hara’s glass house, and who
is one of the society. His natural talents for musick were so
great, that he could not bear the trammels of a scientifick
acquisition of it, and therefore never learned a note, yet he
joins a correct extempore harmony, to the compositions of
Hayden, Pleyel, Bach, Mozart and the other celebrated
composers, particularly in their lively movements; he is
not quite so happy in his accompaniments of Handel, or of
grand or solemn musick generally. His execution of Waltz’s
is in a sweet and tasty style, and he has composed by ear
and committed to memory several pieces, which impress
the hearer with regret, that they must die with their author.
Indeed he now (when too late) regrets himself, that he had
not in his youth, and when he had great opportunities,
added science to natural taste.</p>

<p>The Apollonian society is principally indebted for its
formation to the labours of Mr. S. H. Dearborn,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a New
England man, who came here about a year ago, to exercise
the profession of a portrait painter, and being a very versatile
genius, and having some knowledge of, and taste for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>musick, he soon discovered all the respectable people who
were harmoniously inclined, and succeeded in associating
them into a regular society, which meets one evening every
week, and consists not only of those who can take parts,
but also of many of the most respectable inhabitants of
the town, who do not play, but who become members, for
the sake of admission for themselves and families to the
periodical concerts.</p>

<p>There are also two dramatick societies in Pittsburgh, {67}
one composed of the students of law, and the other of respectable
mechanicks. They occasionally unite with each
other in order to cast the pieces to be performed with more
effect. The theatre is in the great room of the upper story
of the court-house, which from its size, and having several
other contiguous apartments which serve for green room,
dressing rooms, &amp;c. is very well adapted to that purpose.
It is neatly fitted up under the direction of Mr. Dearborn,
whose mechanical genius has rendered him a useful associate
of the disciples of Thespis; whether as machinist,
dresser, scene painter and shifter or actor; particularly
in the part of the garrulous Mrs. Bulgruddery in John
Bull, which he performs with much respectability. Mr. W.
Wilkins<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> excels in genteel comedy; Mr. Johnston does
justice to the part of an Irishman; Mr. Haslet to that of a
Yorkshire farmer or country squire; Mr. Linton in low
comedy is the Edwin of Pittsburgh, and Mr. Van Baun would
be an ornament to any established theatre, either in the
sock or the buskin, he being equally excellent in Octavian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>as in Fribble. The female characters being sustained by
young men, are deficient of that grace and modest vivacity,
which are natural to the fair sex, and which their grosser
lords and masters vainly attempt to copy. On the whole
however, the dramatick societies, exhibit in a very respectable
manner, a rational entertainment to the inhabitants
of Pittsburgh about once monthly through the winter.
They have hitherto confined themselves to the comick
walk, but I have no doubt, that if they appear in the buskin,
they will do equal credit to tragedy.</p>

<p>Some of the gentlemen of the bar resident here, are very
respectable in the profession of the law. Mr. Ross, formerly
a senator, and set up in unsuccessful opposition to
Mr. M’Kean, for governor of the state, is an orator of the
first abilities—his oratory {68} being clear, intelligible and
impressive.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Mr. Mountain, to deep learning, adds careful
investigation of the cause of his client, and is apt and happy
in his quotations. Mr. W. Wilkins is by nature an orator.
His person, action, and gesture are favourable to him—his
words flow at will in a style of manly and bold oratory which
commands attention.—He has no occasion to study his
periods, they form themselves—he enters in earnest into
the cause of his client, and rarely fails to give it its full
weight—but perhaps he sometimes works himself up into
too great warmth of language, which may be occasioned by
the glowing impulse of youth operating on a fertile fancy—he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>apparently not exceeding twenty-five years of age. Mr.
Addison,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Mr. Semple, Mr. Woods, Mr. Baldwin, and
Mr. Collins<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> are spoken of as very able practitioners, but
as I had not the pleasure of witnessing their exertions at the
bar, I cannot take it upon me to describe their talents, even
was I adequate to it.</p>

<p>There are five societies of Christians, which have each
an established minister—Mr. Steele<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the pastor of one of
the Presbyterian societies, possesses all that liberality of
sentiment and Christian charity inculcated by the divine
founder of his religion, and dignifies the pulpit by his clear
and pleasing exposition of the scriptures. Mr. Taylor the
Episcopal minister, is an able mathematician, a liberal
philosopher, and a man of unaffected simplicity of manners.
His discourses from the pulpit are good moral lectures, well
adapted to the understanding of his hearers. He is an
assistant teacher in the academy. Of Mr. Boggs,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the
minister of the other Presbyterian society, {69} or of Mr.
Black, the minister of a large society of a sect of Presbyterians
called covenanters, I am not adequate to speak, not
having yet heard either officiate. Mr. Sheva,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> pastor of
a congregation of German Lutherans, is a man of liberal
morality, and a lively social companion. There are here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>several Roman Catholicks,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
    Methodists,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and Anabaptists—who
have as yet no established place of worship, but
who occasionally meet to profit by the exhortations of some
of their spiritual directors, who travel this way. On the
whole, the religious sects appear to be more free here than
in most places I have visited, from those illiberal and anti-christian
prejudices, which render Christianity the scoff of
even the ignorant Indians, whom we term savages.</p>

<p>But though difference of religious opinions does not cause
any animosity here, politicks have reduced society to a
most deplorable state. There are two parties, which style
themselves Federal republicans, and Democratick republicans,
but who speaking of each other, leave out the word
<i>republican</i>, and call each other Federalists and Democrats.
I have already described their opinions, which are argued
with more warmth, and are productive of more rancour and
violence in Pittsburgh than perhaps in any other part of
America.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> There are very few neutrals, {70} as it requires
a bold independence of sentiment, to prevent a person from
attaching himself to one or other party, and besides, to a
man who has not resources for the employment of time
within himself, the alternative of not being of one or other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>party is insupportable, as he is shunned equally by both,
and in this populous town lives with respect to society, as
though he were in a desert. This may be one cause that
Pittsburgh is not celebrated for its hospitality, another,
(which is equally applicable to most new settled towns,)
is that it is inhabited by people who have fixed here for the
express purpose of making money. This employs the
whole of their time and attention, when they are not occupied
by politicks, and leaves them no leisure to devote
to the duties of hospitality. Another cause, which one
would scarcely suspect, is pride. Those who from the adventitious
circumstance of having settled here at an early
period, and purchased, or became possessed of landed
property, when from its very low value, it was obtained in
the most easy manner, for a mere trifle, now find themselves
rich suddenly, from its rapid increase in value. Those who
came after them, had not the same opportunities, and of
course were not so fortunate. Wealth acquired suddenly,
generally operates on the ignorant, to make them wish to
seem as if they had always been in the same situation; and
in affecting the manners and appearance of the great, they
always overact their part, and assume airs of superiority
{71} even over the really well born and well bred part of the
community, who have been reduced from a more affluent
situation, by misfortune, or who have not been so fortunate
as themselves in acquiring what stands the possessor in lieu
of descent, and all the virtues and accomplishments. This
accounts for the pride which generally pervades the fortunate
first settlers, but it is carried to such extravagant excess,
that I have been credibly informed that some of the
females of this class have styled themselves and their families
the <i>Well born</i>, to distinguish them from those not quite so
wealthy, forgetting that some among them could not tell
who had been their ancestors in the second generation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>This is all matter of ridicule and amusement to a person
possessed of the least philosophy. There is also a very
numerous class, which assumes a certain air of superiority
throughout this whole country—I mean the lawyers.
They (even their students and pupils) arrogate to themselves
the title or epithet of esquire, which the uninformed mass of
the people allow them; and as, by intrigue, they generally
fill all the respectable offices in the government as well as the
legislature, they assume to themselves a consequence to
which they are in no other way entitled.</p>

<p>The profession of physick is also on a very respectable footing
in this town. There being four established physicians.—Doctors
Bedford, Richardson,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Stevenson, and Mowry,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
all of considerable practice, experience, and reputation.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>I shall defer an account of the situation, history and
present state of Pittsburgh, until I have finished {72} my
tour to the westward, when I shall have obtained more
information on so important a subject.</p>

but was soon employed as quartermaster, also serving in that capacity in
the Whiskey Insurrection (1793), and Wayne’s Campaign against the Indians
(1794). His business talents and enterprise were employed in building up the new
town of Pittsburg, where at its inception he had purchased much land. In 1797,
he built the first glass manufactory west of the Alleghenies; about the same time
he made arrangements to transport salt by water from Onondaga, New York,
greatly cheapening the price of that necessity. In 1804, O’Hara was made director
of the branch of the Bank of Pennsylvania established at Pittsburg; and on his
death (1819) left a large estate to his heirs. General O’Hara was generous and

McKean. Although a Federalist, he had sufficiently imbibed Western views to
advocate, while a senator, the forcible seizure of New Orleans from the Spaniards.

<p>On the 18th July, 1807, accompanied by my intelligent
and valuable friend A——, I departed from Pittsburgh, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>a batteau, or flat bottomed skiff, twenty feet long, very
light, and the stern sheets roofed with very thin boards, high
enough to sit under with ease, and long enough to shelter
us when extended on the benches for repose, should we be
benighted occasionally on the river, with a side curtain of
tow cloth as a screen from either the sun or the night air.
We had a pair of short oars, or rather long paddles, for one
person to work both, and a broad paddle to steer with;
and a mast, and a lug or square sail to set when the wind
should favour us; we had a good stock of cold provisions
and liquors. The river being neither flooded, nor very low,
was just in that state, to promise a pleasant passage to its
navigators. The current running between two and three
miles an hour, allowed time to examine every thing worthy
of curiosity, and the water was sufficiently high to prevent
delays through grounding on any of the numerous flats,
which impede the navigation of the first two hundred miles,
during the principal part of the summer and fall, and yet
not so high as to prevent our being able to see and remark
all the shoals or rocks of any consequence, which gave us an
opportunity {73} of proving Mr. Cramer’s Navigator which
we had with us, of correcting it in a few places, and of
adding to it a sketch of the river, in its very winding course,
between Pittsburgh and Limestone or Maysville, in Kentucky.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour after embarking on the Monongahela
we passed its confluence with the Allegheny, and entered
the Ohio formed by the other two.</p>

<p>The Allegheny rises between two and three hundred
miles following its different meanders, N. E. of Pittsburgh.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>Its current runs about three miles an hour except in floods,
when it is sometimes impelled at the rate of six or seven.
Its banks were uninhabited except by the aborigines, and a
line of distant posts fortified by the French, to preserve the
communication by this route between Canada and Louisiana,
previous to the conquest of the former country by the British
in 1759; also to prevent the extension of the Anglo-American
settlements to the westward of this river; and to command
the friendship and trade of the Indians; and to prevent as
much as possible the English from participating with them
in those advantages. Within the last twenty years, the
Indians disliking the extension of the American settlements
into their neighbourhood, have abandoned this whole tract
of country, and have retired to Sandusky, about three hundred
miles further west, with the exception of a tribe under
a celebrated chief called the Cornplanter, which has a town
and settlement near the Allegheny about 120 miles from
Pittsburgh,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and which is gradually falling into an agricultural
life.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>{74}The Europe-American settlements (as I call them
from their consisting principally of emigrants from Britain,
Ireland, and Germany, particularly the two latter) now
extend not only to the banks of the Allegheny, but crossing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>that river, the country has become {75} populous, and many
thriving towns have been erected throughout the whole
country south of lake Erie, not only in Pennsylvania, but in
the adjoining new state of Ohio, which latter has been
settled in that tract, by emigrants from the state of Connecticut,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
to whom Pittsburgh is indebted for a good supply
of cheese<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> not inferior to English.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Allegheny is easy for boats called
<i>keels</i> from fifty to seventy feet long, sharp at both ends,
drawing little water, carrying a good burthen, and calculated
to be set against the stream, so as to surmount it from
eight to twenty miles a day in proportion to the strength of
the current operating against them. The water of this
river is uncommonly clear, occasioned by its gravelly bottom
and the rapidity of its current; and the fish are harder, firmer,
and more delicious, than those caught in the Monongahela,
which rising in the Laurel mountain in Virginia, pursues
a northern course about two hundred miles, (the last half
of which is through a rich and populous country) until it
unites with the Allegheny at Pittsburgh. Flowing generally
through a more level country than the Allegheny, its current
{76} is much more placid, but its waters are always muddy,
from which circumstance it derives its name, which in the
Indian dialect signifies <i>muddy from the mouldering in of
banks</i>. Both it and the Allegheny abound in fish, of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>the white salmon, the perch, the pike and the cat-fish are most
esteemed; there are however several other species.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The Ohio into which we had now entered, takes its name
from its signifying <i>bloody</i> in the Indian tongue, which is
only a modern appellation bestowed on it about the beginning
of the last century by the five nations, after a successful
war, in which they succeeded in subjugating some other
tribes on its banks.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It was called by the French <i>La belle
Riviere</i>, which was a very appropriate epithet, as perhaps
throughout its long course it is not exceeded in beauty by any
other river. It was always known before as a continuation
of the Allegheny, though it more resembles the Monongahela,
both in the muddiness of its waters, and its size: the
latter being about five hundred yards wide, whereas the
former is only about four hundred yards in breadth opposite
Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Leaving the glass house on the left, we passed on the
same hand Saw-mill run, a mill stream with a long wooden
bridge crossing it to Elliot’s mills, the bridge forming a
handsome object in the view. Elliot has here a delightful
spring, bubbling its cool pelucid water from the side of the
rocky bason which receives it, from which it is conveyed by
a pipe through his spring-house, the roof of which joins the
shed which covers the spring.</p>

<p>We passed Robinson’s point on the right with a fine
level, or bottom, as I shall in future according to {77} the
language of the country call all the flats between the hills
and the banks of the river. This bottom well settled and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>cultivated, extends to about four miles below Pittsburgh,
having Brunot’s island opposite its lower extremity. This
island contains near three hundred acres of a most luxuriant
soil, about half of which has been cleared by Dr. Brunot,
a native of France, who adds hospitality and sociality to
the abundance which he derives from his well cultivated
farm.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He has judiciously left the timber standing on the
end of the island nearest Pittsburgh, through which, and a
beautiful locust grove of about twelve acres, an avenue from
his upper landing is led with taste and judgement about half
a mile to his house, which is a good two story cottage, with
large barns, and other appropriate offices near it, and an
excellent garden and nursery. He has fenced the farm
in such a way, as to leave a delightful promenade all round
it, between the fences, and the margin of the river, which he
has purposely left fringed with the native wood about sixty
yards wide, except where occasional openings are made
either for landings, or views, the latter of which are very
fine, particularly that of M’Kee’s romantick rocks opposite,
impending over the narrow rapid which separates them from
the island. M’Kee’s fine farm between the rocks and the
mouth of Chartier creek, and the creek itself, which meanders
through a great part of the rich and plentiful county
of Washington, affording also fine subjects for the landscape
painter.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>On entering the channel to the right of Brunot’s island, I
could not avoid a sensation of melancholy, from its reminding
me of the death of my valued friend George Cochran,
esq. of Natchez, who about three years ago was drowned here
together with a Mr. M’Farlane of Elizabethtown, by the
skiff, in which they were going from the shore to a brig belonging
to the latter, being carried by the current {78} against
the brig’s cable, and overset. In his death, his friends had
cause to lament the loss of a warm hearted, benevolent,
generous, and properly conducted man in every sense of the
word, and the world was deprived of one of those characters,
which is occasionally but rarely allowed it, to prevent that
general obloquy to which it would otherwise be subjected
from the natural depravity of mankind.</p>

<p>I was not acquainted with Mr. M’Farlane, but from the
manner in which I have heard him spoken of by those who
were, he merited a longer enjoyment of this probationary
life. They were found two days after, a few miles below,
brought to Pittsburgh, and interred in two adjoining graves,
in the burying ground of the new Presbyterian meeting-house.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>
<p>Passing his garden, we gave and received an adieu from
Dr. Brunot, and the recollection of a social and agreeable
day, which I enjoyed with a party at his house on the 4th
of this month, when he had a few friends to commemorate
that anniversary of a new era in the annals of history, <i>the
Independence of the United States of America</i>, aided to
dispel those gloomy, selfish ideas, which we who remain behind
can seldom avoid indulging, when we think on our
being for ever deprived of society which was dear to us—even
though we have every reason to be certain that they
were prepared for whatever fate may await them in futurity,
and though we know that longer continuance here, might
have subjected the subject of our regret to some of those
casualties in the affairs of men, which might have embittered
their future life.</p>

<p>The course of the river is generally about N. N. W. from
Pittsburgh to Beaver, about twenty-eight miles. We continued
to descend it, our attention occupied by frequent
changes of prospect, caused by its winding course. From
the point below Brunot’s island, is a fine vista of the river
with hills on the right and {79} a bottom on the left; a very
high hill in front cultivated on the top, Baldwin’s mill on
the right three miles distant, reflected by the water to double
its size; the well frequented road to Beaver on the same
hand, and farms and farm houses in view of each other;
the scenery enlivened by multitudes of fish sporting near
the surface of the glassy element. Baldwin’s mill-house is
well built of stone over a dam in the river, which conveys
the water to the wheel, from whence it runs out under the
arch which supports the house.</p>

<p>We had passed a small island of about three acres, called
Cow island, separated from Neville’s or Long island by a
channel of one hundred and fifty yards. This latter takes
its name of <i>Long</i> from its extending six miles down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>river from opposite Baldwin’s mill, it is narrow, but its
soil being of the first quality, it might be divided into several
good farms; there is however but one on it as yet, cultivated
for the proprietor, major Craig of Pittsburgh, who has on
the middle of the island a large but very plain wooden
farm house of two stories, and about sixty feet long.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>We here overtook a covered flat, with two families of
the name of Frazey, migrating from the neighbourhood of
Elizabethtown in New Jersey, to Cincinnatti in Ohio. They
had embarked at Redstone on the Monongahela.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The
father of one of the families was dangerously ill with a
nervous fever and deranged in his intellects.</p>

<p>Hog island on the left just below Neville’s island, is
very small, and immediately below it also on the left we
passed Middletown, lately laid out, containing ten houses
including barns, and opposite to it, a Mr. White’s finely
situated house.</p>

<p>From a point two miles below Middletown, the river
opening gradually into a long reach, has a fine effect to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>the eye. A little below the point, a charmingly situated
farm on the right exciting our inquiry, {80} we were informed
that it was squire Ways. The squire however, was badly
lodged, if he had no better house than the small log hovel
we saw on the bank. Deadman’s island a little below is
small, covered with aquatick shrubs and plants, and so low,
that it must always be inundated in moderate risings of the
river, which is not <i>here</i> more than a hundred and fifty yards
wide, and in general not exceeding two hundred. The banks
on each side abound with partridges whose responsive calls
are continually heard, interrupted by the buzz of multitudes
of large horse flies, which probably attracted by the odour
of our provisions, seemed much more pleased with our boat
than we were with them.</p>

<p>Eight miles below Middletown, we passed Logstown on
the left: This is a scattering hamlet, of four or five log cabins,
in the neighbourhood of which, on the opposite side of the
river, a considerable tribe of Indians resided, until after the
reduction of Fort Du Quesne, now Pittsburgh, by general
Forbes in 1758.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>From Logstown a mile and a half to Crow’s island which
is small, the banks are very pleasant, rising gradually from
the water’s edge, and having a fine bottom on the right.
Here we met two large keel boats loaded with cotton in
bales, from Nashville in Tennessee bound to Pittsburgh,
out twenty-six days. They had nine men in each—one
steering, six poling, and two resting.</p>

<p>Half a mile from hence on the right, is a good log house
with a sign of a white horse, kept by James Knox; in passing,
it, a young woman answered several questions we asked her
very civilly; which I mention as a rare circumstance, as the
inhabitants of the banks of the Ohio, have too generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>acquired a habit, of either not deigning an answer to the
interrogatories of the numerous river travellers, or of giving
them a short and boorish one, or of turning {81} their
questions into ridicule; which proceeds from the impertinent
manner in which they are generally hailed and addressed
by the people in the boats.</p>

<p>Two miles lower we passed a good house and a saw mill
in a beautiful rural situation on the left bank, and here we
met a decent looking man, polling a skiff against the current:
He was going to Pittsburgh and had come upwards of
twenty miles since morning.</p>

<p>At half past four in the afternoon we were abreast of
Big Beaver creek or river on the right, five miles below the
saw mill. It empties through a level, and is about fifty
yards wide at its mouth, with a gentle current.</p>

<p>Some boys on the beach mischievously misinformed us
respecting the proper landing, to the town of Beaver, which
is but a little way beyond the creek, instead of which we
rowed a mile lower down, and then had to set our skiff across
a bar, which extends above a mile in front of the right bank.
After landing, we had to climb a precipice to a log cabin,
on the top and edge of the cliff, near two hundred feet above
the surface of the river: Here we got directions for our
path, and after a walk of half a mile, we reached the town
of Beaver.</p>

<p>It stands on a stony plain on the top of the high cliff which
conceals it from the river, and contains about thirty indifferent
houses, much scattered, on three parallel streets. There
is a stone gaol not quite finished, which was the only publick
building we noticed.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The inhabitants not finding water
at a convenient depth, have, in preference to digging very
deep wells, led it by wooden pipes from a hill near a mile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>from the town, and have placed publick wooden fountains
in the streets at convenient distances.</p>

<p>{82} We were shewn the scite of Fort M’Intosh, of which
no vestige remains except the hearth of the officers’ fire
place: It is on the edge of the cliff commanding the river.
Altogether, Beaver seems to be very badly situated on the
high plain, when it ought to have been placed at the confluence
of Beaver creek with the Ohio, where there is a bottom
with room enough for a town, and an excellent landing,
and where are now two good looking houses with tavern
signs. The neighbouring high situation notwithstanding
its inconveniences, was probably preferred, on account of
the superior salubrity of the air.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>On entering Beaver, we refreshed ourselves with six
cents worth of whiskey and water at general Lacock’s tavern.
He is one of the representatives in the assembly of the state,
and has both considerable influence and abilities. I had
heard him in the house of representatives when I was at
Lancaster in the winter, and was much entertained by the
wit and humour he displayed in the course of a debate on
fixing a permanent seat of government.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> We had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>the pleasure of seeing the general now, and proceeded from
his house to Mr. Wilson’s, one of the best in the place, conformably
to a promise I had given him in Pittsburgh. Mrs.
Wilson, a very pretty woman, told us that her husband was
absent in Philadelphia:—We left our names, walked across
the street to Hemphill’s tavern, got some information respecting
the country; and then returned to our boat, meeting on
our way the constable crying at publick sale, a poor horse
attached for debt, for which the last bid was thirteen dollars
twenty-five cents. It is seven years since Beaver was laid
out for a town.</p>

<p>Cornplanter, the chief of a large band of Senecas, was for many years a much
dreaded hostile. He is known to have been with the French at Braddock’s defeat;
later, influenced by the British agents, he took part in the massacre at Wyoming
and in many border raids. Brodhead led out an expedition in 1779, which burned
the towns of this chieftain; and at the close of the Revolution, becoming impressed
with the growing power of the Americans, the wily warrior professed peace, assisted
in securing the treaties of Fort Stanwix (1784) and Fort Harmar (1789), and had
an interview with Washington in 1790. His professions secured him a large reservation
in the present county of Warren, Pennsylvania, where he lived quietly until

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> In 1798, the Quakers of Philadelphia sent out a committee of three or five,
men and women, among the Cornplanters Indians, with implements of husbandry,
to instruct the poor natives in the arts of agriculture and comfortable living. In
these, with much good example, industry, and perseverance, they have succeeded
wonderfully in bringing their red brethren to a considerable advanced state of
civilization, to a knowledge of agriculture, the mechanick arts, and a practice of
the social virtues. I had the pleasure of conversing with <i>Joel Swain</i>, one of the
members of the committee not long since, who observed, that the farms of the natives
extended several miles on both banks of the Allegheny river, well stocked with
cattle, horses, and hogs. That one or two of the Indians had already learnt how
to make their own plough-irons, axes, hoes, &amp;c. while others were learning to make
tubs and buckets, and that he expected to learn an ingenuous boy to make spinning
wheels the ensuing year, for which he was then hunting irons. That a tanyard
was about to be sunk for the purpose of learning them the art of tanning. That
the Indian women had spun and wove about seventy yards of flaxen linen that year,
1808, and was able to knit their own stockings. That they, the committee, had got
both men and women to quit the habit of drinking whiskey, or any other kind of
ardent spirits, either at home or abroad—This circumstance has been frequently
witnessed among those who came down to Pittsburgh with skins, trading, and who
uniformly refuse <i>whiskey</i> when offered to them by those to whom they sell their
skins, shaking their heads, saying, <i>too scos, too scos</i>, meaning, <i>not good</i>, repeating
in broken English, “may be <i>scos</i>, good, for white man, but <i>too scos</i>, bad, for Indian.”</p>

<p>The Quakers of Baltimore, under the same Christian, and highly laudable
spirit, sent out in 1805, a deputation among the <i>Shawaneese</i>, <i>Delawares</i>, and
<i>Wyandots</i>, and such other tribes as they could find it practicable to visit, to see
what might be wanting to forward the interests and happiness of the natives, to
some of whose tribes they had forwarded a few articles of farming utensils in 1798,
particularly to those situated on the banks of the Tuskarowas river; since which,
ploughs, hoes, axes, &amp;c. have been forwarded to Fort Wayne as presents to the
Indians on the Wabash, where considerable clearings and improvements have been
made under the particular direction of <span class="smcap">Philip Dennis</span>, agent of the Friends’
society.</p>

<p>The Western Missionary society are also laudably engaged in this Christian
like work, and we hope and flatter ourselves, that much good will be done, and the
poor natives be advanced to a state of rational life. The Rev. Joseph Badger
resides on the Sandusky, where no doubt his indefatigable industry will be turned
to the best advantage for the welfare of the Indians in that quarter. He has one
farm already stocked with cattle, &amp;c. a tolerable crop was raised last year—and a
school is kept to teach the children the English language. Divine service is also
held among them frequently, where men, women, and children attend, to receive
the instruction of their worthy pastor. Mr. Badger was among us not long ago, and
he gives a flattering account of the aptness of the Indian children, and their willingness
and desire for learning, and states that they do not want for capacity.—This
subject opens a wide field for the humane and philosophick citizen, and we
hope the minds of many will be drawn to pay it that attention it so richly
merits.—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">[51]</a> The original owner of the farm from which McKee’s Rocks took their name
was the notorious Tory Indian agent, Alexander McKee. This tract he bought of
Bouquet in 1764, and lived upon his property until the outbreak of the Revolution.
McKee had (1772) been appointed by Sir William Johnson, deputy for Indian
affairs, and was listed by Lord Dunmore (1775) as one whose loyalty to the British
could be relied upon. He became, therefore, an object of suspicion to his neighbors,
and General Hand, commandant at Fort Pitt, placed him upon parole. The
night of March 28, 1778, McKee with Matthew Elliot and Simon Girty, broke his
parole and fled to the British at Detroit. There he was rewarded with a captaincy,
and employed in leading Indian raiding parties against the American settlements.
After Hamilton’s capture (1778) he was made Indian agent for the Western department,
and throughout the Revolution, and the entire period of Indian wars,
his influence with the savages was exerted to maintain their enmity to the Americans.
After the battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), Wayne burned the store-house
and goods of McKee at the Maumee Rapids, the renegade having himself retired
to Detroit, where he received a letter of commendation from the governor-general
of Canada, and promotion in the British service. When the latter evacuated
Detroit (1796), McKee retired to Sandwich, where he continued his official duties
until his death (January 14, 1799). His services had been rewarded by large
grants of land on the Canadian side of the Detroit River, upon which his descendants
established themselves. His Pittsburg property passed into the hands of a
brother, whose descendants were living thereon in 1847.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a> Major Isaac Craig was one of the most prominent of the early citizens of
Pittsburg. Coming from Ireland to America in 1766, he settled at Philadelphia
as a carpenter, and being commissioned first lieutenant of marines (1775) took
part in the expedition to the West Indies. His command was later transferred to
the infantry and then to the artillery branch of the service, wherein Craig was
wounded at Brandywine, and performed gallant services in Sullivan’s Indian Campaign.
Having taken command of Fort Pitt in 1780, he was ordered the next year
to reinforce George Rogers Clark with stores and artillery for an expedition to
Detroit. This proving abortive, Craig continued at Pittsburg, strengthening its
defenses, and securing it against attack. In 1783, he bought the first land sold
within the city of Pittsburg, and shortly formed a partnership for general business
with Colonel Bayard, a Revolutionary officer. During the Indian campaigns
Craig acted as military storekeeper, forwarding provisions to Wayne, and erecting
defensive works at Pittsburg (Fort Fayette), Wheeling, and Presqu’ Isle; but as
a noted Federalist he was removed (1802) by Jefferson from official position.
Major Craig also aided in preparations for the War of 1812-15, but at its close
retired to Neville’s Island (his wife’s property) and resided thereon until his death
in 1826.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The present town of Beaver was laid out in 1792, and eight years later made
the county town for the newly-erected Beaver County. Fort McIntosh was a
Revolutionary post erected (1778) by General Lachlin McIntosh, who had been
chosen to succeed General Hand at Fort Pitt. It was the first military post in the
Indian territory beyond the Allegheny and Ohio rivers. An important Indian
treaty was held at this place in 1784; but four years later the fort was demolished,
the erection of lower posts on the Ohio having rendered it superfluous.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> The career of General Abner Lacock is illustrative of the ability and force
of character that rendered so many pioneers eminent. Of Virginia birth, he had
but slight education, migrating to Washington County, Pennsylvania, at an early
age. When the town of Beaver was erected he bought some of the first lots, and
served as justice of the peace as well as tavern-keeper. His entry into general
politics was signalized (1801) by election to the Pennsylvania assembly, and in
1808 he was chosen state senator. National affairs claimed him when elected
United States Senator (1813), in which position he championed internal improvements
and popular education. Having incurred the resentment of Jackson by
his services on the committee to investigate the Seminole War, his retirement
ensued; whereupon he returned to Beaver, whose citizen he remained until his
death in 1837.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Beaver creek—State division line—Faucetstown—Croxton’s—Squire
Brown’s.</p>
</div>


<p>A ferry two miles below Beaver is a handsome situation,
beyond which the banks are high on both sides, and the river
does not exceed one hundred and fifty yards wide.</p>

<p>About half past seven, it began to rain with heavy thunder
and sharp lightning. We huddled into the stern under the
awning, and I sculled with one oar to keep the boat in the
channel, in hopes of getting to Georgetown; but the storm
increasing, we judged it more prudent to stop at nine o’clock
where we saw a light on the left bank. We were received
very hospitably in their small log house by Mr. and Mrs.
Potts.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Our landlady gave us bread and milk, which after
changing our wet clothes, we supped on sumptuously. We
then made some milk punch, which our landlord partook
of with us with great gout, entertaining us with some good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>songs, and long stories about his travels. Time thus passed
away while the storm pelted without, and it was not until
eleven o’clock that we stretched ourselves on the floor,
with our feet to the fire, and enjoyed a good nap, resisting
the kind importunities of the Potts’s to take their own bed,
their other one being filled with their five children. And
here I must remark that throughout this whole country,
wherever you see a cabin, you see a swarm of children.</p>

<p>At six o’clock on Sunday morning the 19th July, we left
Potts’s, after having recompensed them for their hospitality.
This was ten miles below Beaver, and two and a half above
Georgetown. There are three small islands in that distance
called First, Second, and Grape island.</p>

<p>{84} I landed at Georgetown on the left, which contains
about thirty houses in a fine situation, on a narrow plain
extending from the high river bank, to the hills which surround
it like an amphitheatre. Though it is a post town,
and a considerable thoroughfare of travellers, it is nevertheless
on the decline, there being only twenty-five houses
inhabited.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> A shower coming on, I took shelter in the
house of a very communicative elderly man, whose wife
was young and very handsome, though an half blood Indian.</p>

<p>Little Beaver creek<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> nearly opposite to Georgetown, is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>handsome little river, about thirty yards wide; half a mile
below which, we saw the division line between Pennsylvania
and Virginia on the left, {85} and between the former and
Ohio on the right, which were cleared of wood forty feet
wide in their whole length some years ago; a new growth
of trees, bids fair to obliterate very shortly these temporary
boundaries.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Near this on the left bank opposite a small island, is a
curious stratum of slate, covering a substratum of coal,
which also shews itself.</p>

<p>A mile below this is Custard’s island, a mile long, opposite
the lower end of which on the left, is the very pleasantly
situated house and farm of Mr. Stewart, in passing which
we were asked by some people at the landing, if we had seen
a man polling up a skiff yesterday on his way to Pittsburgh,
and they pointed out his house on the opposite bank, which
he had left yesterday; which was matter of astonishment to
us, how the man we hailed in this skiff above Beaver, could
have surmounted so many ripples and rapids in so short a
time; it evinced uncommon strength, activity, and perseverance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>A mile and a half below Stewart’s, we passed Faucetstown,
a hamlet of five or six houses and a ferry, from whence
is a road thirty miles to Warren in Ohio. Here I observed
some seines for fishing, made by fastening bushes together
with the tough and flexible stalks of the wild grape, with
which this whole western country abounds.</p>

<p>Two miles below Faucetstown, on the right, is a remarkable
rocky cliff, three hundred feet perpendicular, from
which to Baker’s island of a mile in length, is two miles,
and from thence about a mile further, we passed on the right,
Yellow creek,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> a handsome little river thirty yards wide,
with Mr. Pettyford’s good stone house well situated on its
left bank.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>{86} From Yellow creek the appearance of the soil and
country is better than above it, and the river is very beautiful,
being in general about a quarter of a mile wide, interspersed
with several islands, which add much to its beauty;
some being partly cultivated and partly in wood, some
wholly in wood, and some covered with low aquatick shrubs
and bushes; and all fringed with low willows, whose yellowish
green foliage, contrasted with the rich and variegated
verdure of the gigantick forest trees, the fields of wheat and
Indian corn, and the dwarf alders, other shrubbery and
reeds of the inundated islands, which they surround, mark
their bounds as on a coloured map. First Neasley’s cluster
of small islands, two miles below Yellow creek; then Black’s
island a mile and a half long, two miles below them, and
lastly, Little island close to the west end of Black’s, joined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>by a sand bar to the right shore, where Jacob Neasley has a
good two story wooden house, with a piazza.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Four miles further we stopped at Wm. Croxton’s tavern,
the sign of the Black Horse, on the Virginia side, and got
a bowl of excellent cider-oil. This is stronger than Madeira
and is obtained from the cider by suffering it to freeze in the
cask during the winter, and then drawing off and barrelling
up the spirituous part which remains liquid, while the aqueous
is quickly congealed by the frost. Croxton and his
wife had a youthful appearance, notwithstanding they had
eight children, seven of whom were living.</p>

<p>He was born in this neighbourhood, lived here during
the last Indian war, and cultivated a bottom opposite,
through which flows a rivulet called Croxton’s run, which
turns a grist and saw mill.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> On the United States appropriating
the N. W. territory, now the state of Ohio, he lost
all that property by its being purchased by others, before he
became informed of the necessity of his securing his tenure
by obtaining a grant from the government. He complained
{87} of a toothache, from the torture of which I relieved him,
by burning the nerve with a hot knitting needle, which
however did not prevent him from charging us for our cider.</p>

<p>On the opposite bank a mile below Croxton’s, a Mr.
White of Middleton in Virginia, is building a fine house of
hewn stone; and a mile further on the same side, we admired
the romantick situation of a farm house, with a garden tastily
filled with a profusion of flowers; opposite to which on the
Virginia side, is a remarkable cliff near the top of the high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>river hill, occasioned by a large piece of the hill having
broken off and fallen down.</p>

<p>Four miles below Croxton’s we passed Brown’s island,
containing three hundred and fifty acres of first rate land,
on the right, and opposite the lower end of it on the left
we stopped for the night at Brown’s, who is a magistrate,
and has a noble farm and a house very pleasantly situated
on a high bank, with a steep slope to the river.</p>

<p>We found the squire weighing sugar, which he had sold
to Mr. Sumrall of Pittsburgh, who owns some regular
freighting keel boats, who with one of them was now on
his return from Cumberland river, and had also stopped here
for the night.</p>

<p>The negroes, cattle, offices, and the appearance of every
thing here, indicated the greatest abundance of the produce
of this plentiful country. Neither the old squire nor his
wife, ever knew confinement by accident or bad health,
until about two months ago, when by a fall from her horse,
she dislocated her hip, and broke one of her knees. Her
son restored the limbs to their places, and she employed no
surgeon, but is curing herself gradually, though slowly, by an
embrocation of camphorated spirit.</p>

<p>After supping with the old gentleman, near his old wife’s
bed side, on apple pye, bread, butter and milk, he kissed
her, and then shewed us to a room {88} with four beds in it,
one of which he occupied himself, and gave us possession
of another, which we were not allowed to possess in peace,
as its indigenous inhabitants, indignant at our intrusion,
assailed us all night with such fury, as to drive us from
their quarters at the first dawn of day. The old man had
entertained us until a late hour, by narrating to us his situation,
and that of his family. His children have all good
farms, and he intends making no will, that they may inherit
equally, (according to the very equitable law of this country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>respecting intestate inheritance) whatever he may die
possessed of, which he gave us to understand was very
considerable.—One daughter is married to a Mr. Madan,
an Irishman, to whom he gave a farm with her, which
Madan sold for a thousand dollars five years ago, and
removed to St. Genevieve on the Mississippi, where he is
now a land surveyor with an income of two thousand dollars
per annum. Two years ago, squire Brown, notwithstanding
his age, about seventy, paid his daughter a visit, a distance
of a thousand miles.</p>

<p>Though he does not keep a tavern, he knows how to
charge as if he did, we having to pay him half a dollar for
our plain supper, plainer bed, and two quarts of milk we
took with us next morning; which was very high in a country
where cash is very scarce, and every thing else very abundant.</p>

a large paper mill, all within two miles of its mouth; the latter has been lately
erected, and is owned by Jacob Bowman of Brownsville, John Bever of Georgetown,
and John Coulter, who resides at the mill. Over this creek, about a mile
from its mouth, a new toll bridge was erected in the summer and fall of 1809, on the
road leading from Washington county to New Lisbon, Canton, Worster, &amp;c. state of
Ohio. About a mile above Little Beaver, in the bed of the Ohio, and near the
north western side, a substance bubbles up, and may be collected at particular
times on the surface of the water, similar to <i>Seneca oil</i>. When the water is not too
high, it can be strongly smelt while crossing the river at Georgetown: It is presumed
to rise from or through a bed of mineral coal embowelled under the bed of
the river. The virtues of the Seneca oil are similar to those of the <i>British oil</i>, and
supposed to be equally valuable in the cures of rheumatick pains, &amp;c.—Large
quantities of the Seneca oil is collected on Oil creek, a branch of the Allegheny
river, and sold at from one dollar and a half to two dollars per gallon. The mode
of collecting it is this; the place where it is found bubbling up in the creek is surrounded
by a wall or dam to a narrow compass, a man then takes a blanket, flannel,
or other woollen cloth, to which the oil adheres, and spreading it over the surface
of the enclosed pond, presses it down a little, then draws it up, and running the
cloth through his hands, squeezes out the oil into a vessel prepared for the purpose;
thus twenty or thirty gallons of pure oil can be obtained in two or three days by one
man.—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

<p>At 6 o’clock on Monday, 20th July, we proceeded on our
voyage, and three miles below Brown’s passed a point or
rather a peninsula on the left, formed by a remarkable turn
in the river, which takes a direction due east for two miles;
its general course from Big Beaver to Baker’s island having
been west, and from thence south. On the peninsula is a
well cleared and beautifully situated farm, and there is a
remarkable heap of loose rocks on the opposite shore, where
a small creek falls into the Ohio, with a neat stone cottage
at its mouth. At the end of the easterly reach is a good
two story stone house of a Mr. Kelly, just under a hill on the
Ohio side, with a fine bottom opposite.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>
<p>At a little before eight o’clock we stopped at Steubenville,
the capital of Jefferson county in Ohio, seven miles from
Brown’s. This town has been settled about eight years,
chiefly by emigrants from the state of Jersey. It contains
one hundred and sixty houses, including a new gaol of hewn
stone, a court-house of square logs (which it is said is to be
soon replaced by a new one<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> of better materials), and a
brick presbyterian church. There are four or five different
sects of Christians in this town, but no established minister,
except a Mr. Snodgrass to the presbyterians, and a Mr.
Doddridge, who comes from {90} Charlestown in Virginia,
every other Sunday, to officiate to the episcopalians in the
court-house, which is occasionally used for the same purpose
by the other sects.</p>

<p>There is a land-office here for the sale of the publick
lands, from which large sums in Spanish dollars are sent
annually to the treasury of the United States in Washington.
Perhaps this is one cause of the town having increased so
rapidly. Another may be its very handsome situation.
The first street, which is parallel to the river, is on a narrow
flat, sufficiently raised above the river floods; while the
rest of the town is about twenty feet perpendicular above it,
on an extensive plain, rising gradually with a gentle slope
to the foot of the hills which surround it in a semicircle like
an amphitheatre, about a mile distant. On one of those a
Mr. Smith has a house and farm which seems to impend
over the south end of the town, from an elevation of four
hundred feet perpendicular from the bed of the river.
Mr. Bazil. Wells, who is joint proprietor of the soil with Mr.
James Ross of Pittsburgh, has a handsome house and finely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>improved garden and farm on the bank of the Ohio, a quarter
of a mile below the town.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>We remained about an hour in Steubenville, (which is
named in honour of the late major-general baron Steuben,
the founder of the present American military tacticks): We
then pursued our course down the river, passing at half a
mile a point on the left, where is a tavern with a fine extensive
bottom behind it; and four and a half miles further,
we left Mingo bottom island (very small) on the left; half
a mile below which on the right is Mr. Potter’s handsome
square roofed house, and a quarter of a mile lower down is
Mr. Pratt’s neat frame cottage, ornamented like Potter’s
with weeping willows and Lombardy poplars. A mile and
a quarter from hence we passed two small creeks called
Cross creeks, one on {91} each hand, and a mile and a half
below them, on turning a point on the left, we saw Charlestown,
half a league before us, on the Virginia side, making
a handsome appearance, with the white spire of the court
house, and several good looking private houses, which are
distinctly seen from the river, on account of the situation
being on a lower bank than that of Steubenville.</p>

<p>At eleven we landed in Charlestown,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> went to the inn
where the mail stage between Pittsburgh and Wheeling
stops, and ordered dinner, during the preparation of which,
we amused ourselves with walking through the town. It
was laid out about fourteen years ago, and now contains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>about eighty houses of various materials—brick, stone and
wood, principally in one street parallel to the Ohio. In
the middle is a convenient little court-house of stone, with
a small, light cupola spire. The gaol is behind it, and in
front is the pillory,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> on a plan differing from any I ever saw
elsewhere: A large, round wooden cover, like an immense
umbrella, serving as a shade for the criminal in the stocks,
or for a platform for one in the pillory to stand on, or for a
shelter from sun or rain to the inhabitants who meet on
business in front of the court-house, the place generally
used as a sort of exchange in the small towns in this country.
A Col. Connel, who is a farmer, and clerk of the county
courts of Brooke county, has a very large but unfinished
house of hewn stone near the court-house. The academy
is a good brick building on the ascent of the hill behind the
town, and was a good school until broken up by some political
division among the inhabitants, which induced Mr.
Johnston, the last master, to remove to Beaver {92} in
Pennsylvania, where he now keeps the county clerk’s
office.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Bakewell from England, who has been established
here about two years, politely shewed us his manufactury
of pottery and queensware. He told us that the business
would answer very well, could workmen be got to be depended
upon; but that those he has hitherto employed, have
always quit his service before the term of the expiration of
their contracts, notwithstanding any law to the contrary; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>two of them have actually set up small manufacturies in
Charlestown, one of queensware in opposition to him, and
the other of tobacco pipes. Bakewell’s ware is very good,
but not so fine, nor so well glazed as that manufactured in
England, owing probably to the difference of materials, as
the process is the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Doddridge who officiates alternately here and at
Steubenville, to the episcopal congregations, first practised
law, then physick, and now adds the trade of a tanner to
the profession of divinity.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The wells here are dug forty to fifty feet deep before water
is come at, but that inconvenience might be easily remedied
by conveying water to the town in pipes from the surrounding
hills, which will doubtless be the case, should it ever become
a manufacturing town; which a few more inhabitants of
equal spirit and enterprize with Bakewell would soon effect.</p>

<p>Buffalo creek falls into the Ohio at the south end of the
town, after a course of forty or fifty miles through Washington
county in Pennsylvania, and {93} the narrow tongue
of Virginia in which Charlestown is situated. It had a
wooden bridge about forty yards in length across the mouth
of it, on the post road to Wheeling, which was carried away
last spring by a flood.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

</div>


<p>We proceeded after dinner from Charlestown, three and
a half miles to a ferry, and two miles further, we passed a
point and a tavern on the right, a mile and a half below
which on the same hand, is the straggling town and fine
settlement of Warren, laid out by Mr. Kimberly, the proprietor,
five years ago, but it is only within two years that
it has began to assume the appearance of a town. It contains
thirty-eight dwelling houses, charmingly situated on
an extensive bottom, the largest I had noticed since leaving
Pittsburgh, with Indian Short creek emptying into the Ohio
at its southern extremity.</p>

<p>Three miles lower, we passed Pike island, which is about
three quarters of a mile long, and seems capable of cultivation,
though perhaps rather low. Opposite to it is the
boundary line between Jefferson and Belmont counties in
Ohio.</p>

<p>Two miles further, at six o’clock we landed at Roland’s
ferry, on the left, and found Roland and his son employed
building a boat on the bank. He had removed from Pittsburgh
last April, and now rents {94} a small farm from Mr.
Woods, the county surveyor, who has a handsome house in
sight, a little remote from the river where he resides, another
on the bank a little lower down, and a cottage amongst the
woods on the highest neighbouring hill, intended for a
banqueting house during summer, and commanding an
extensive prospect. At Roland’s invitation, we walked to his
cottage a little distant from the river bank. His wife and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>very fine girl his eldest daughter were spinning cotton,
while a younger one was attending the ferry, who though a
delicate and pretty girl, paddled the skiff backwards and
forwards as well as a man could do. He has been very
industrious, as besides having built several skiffs since his
removal, he had planted and cultivated twelve acres of the
finest corn I ever saw, some of it now twelve feet high, just
beginning to ear. He had also a large garden well stocked
with useful roots and vegetables.</p>

<p>At seven we left Roland’s, and three miles and a half
below, passed between the north end of Wheeling island on
the right, and the principal part of the town of Wheeling
on the left,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> which is situated on so high a cliff, with the
avenues from the river so steep, that on account of the apparent
difficulty of getting our baggage carried up, we preferred
going on to where the cliff was considerably lower,
landing just under Sprigg’s tavern near the ship-yards, a
little above the confluence of Wheeling creek with the Ohio.</p>

<p>This being a great thoroughfare, on account of its situation
where the great post roads from Philadelphia, Baltimore,
and the northern part of Virginia unite, and cross the
river, on the route through the states of Ohio and Kentucky,
to Tennessee and New Orleans, we found several travellers
of various descriptions in the house, and after partaking
with them of a good supper, we went out to saunter until bed
time through the town, into which we had to {95} ascend a
steep but short hill. It appeared very lively, the inhabitants
being about their doors, or in the street, enjoying
the fresh air of a clear moonlight evening, while two flutes
were playing <i>en duo</i> the simple but musical Scots ballad of
Roy’s wife of Aldwalloch, the prime part very tastily executed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>Yet notwithstanding appearances, our impression
of the town was not the most favourable, nor after tolerable
beds and a good breakfast next morning, had we reason to
alter our opinion when we examined it by day light.</p>

<p>It contains one hundred and twenty houses of all descriptions
from middling downwards, in a street about half a mile
long, parallel to the river, on a bank of about one hundred
feet perpendicular, which the face of the cliff almost literally
is, of course the avenues to the landings are very steep and
inconvenient. The court-house of stone with a small
belfry, has nothing in beauty to boast of. The gaol joins
it in the rear.</p>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Zanes, the original proprietor, now
regrets that he had not placed the town on the flat below,
at the conflux of the Wheeling and Ohio, where Spriggs’s
inn and the ship-yards now are, instead of cultivating it as
a farm until lately, when a resolve of congress to open a new
publick state road from the metropolis through the western
country, which will come to the Ohio near the mouth of
Wheeling creek, induced him to lay it out in town lots, but
I fear he is too late to see it become a considerable town to
the prejudice of the old one, notwithstanding its more advantageous
situation.—The present town does not seem
to thrive, if one may judge by the state of new buildings,
two only of which I saw going forward in it. The stores also
appeared rather thinly stocked with goods, and the retail
prices are high. When the new road is finished, it will
doubtless be of great use to Wheeling, as it will be a more
direct route to the western states, {96} than any of the others
hitherto used, and besides there are no material impediments
to the navigation of the Ohio with the usual craft, below
that town in the driest seasons, when the river is at the lowest.</p>

<p>The surrounding country in sight is hilly and broken,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>but I am informed that it is very rich and plentiful at a short
distance from the river.</p>

<p>Wheeling island in front of the town, is about a mile
long, and half a mile wide in its broadest part. It is very
fertile, and is all cultivated as a farm by Mr. Zanes. The
post and stage road to Chilicothe in Ohio, goes across it,
which occasions two ferries, an inconvenience which will be
remedied by the new state road crossing by one ferry
below the island.</p>

<p>Indian Wheeling creek, a fine mill stream joins the Ohio
from the N. W. opposite the middle of the island, and Mr.
Zanes has lately laid out a new town there named Canton,
which has now thirteen houses, but from its proximity to
Wheeling, it never can become considerable.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>On the 21st July at eight A. M. we left Wheeling, observing
nothing very interesting, until we reached Little
Grave creek, eleven miles below at {97} half past eleven
o’clock. The creek, which is very small, puts in from the
Virginia side, and there is a ferry-house at the mouth of it,
where we landed, and had a pleasant walk on a very good
wagon road of half a mile to Tomlinson’s, the proprietor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>of the surrounding soil. He has been settled here thirty
years, but always forted until the conclusion of the Indian
war by General Wayne. He then attempted to establish
a town on the opposite side of the creek from his house; but
it remains without augmentation, with only eleven cottages
and cabins. The neighbouring country however is
improving, though slowly. Mr. Tomlinson has a very good
two story brick house, almost finished, fine apple and peach
orchards, and a good farm.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Tomlinson obligingly permitted one of her sons to
guide us to what is called the Indian grave, which is a short
quarter of a mile to the southward of the house. It is a
circular mound, like the frustum of a cone, about one hundred
and eighty yards in circumference round the base,
sixty round the flat on the top, and about seventy feet perpendicular
height. In the centre of the flat top is a shallow
hollow, like the filled up crater of an old volcano, which
hollow or settle is said to have been formed within the
memory of the first neighbouring settlers, and is supposed
by them to be occasioned by the settling of the earth on the
decayed bodies.</p>

<p>The whole mount appears to be formed of clay, and from
its regularity, is evidently a work of art, though I am not
of opinion that it has been a general or publick cemetery,
but either a mausoleum raised over, and in memory of some
great Indian chief, a temple for religious worship, or the
scite of a fortification, or citadel to serve as a place of retreat
from a superior foe. About three years ago, the neighbours
perforated the north side, at about half the elevation, digging
in horizontally about twelve feet, without any {98} other
satisfaction to their curiosity, than the finding of part of a
human jaw bone, the bone rough and honeycombed, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>the teeth entire, and the surrounding clay of a white chalky
consistence.</p>

<p>There are four or five small mounds all within a few
hundred yards of the great one, each about thirty feet diameter,
much lower in proportion than it, all rounded over the
tops, and like the great one, shewing their antiquity by the
size of the trees, plants, and shrubs which cover them, and
having more than it the appearance of tumuli.</p>

<p>The bark of the trees which crown this remarkable monument,
is covered by the initials of visitors cut into it, wherever
they could reach—the number of which, considering the
remote situation, is truly astonishing.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>On returning to our boat we found a floating store at the
landing. It was a large square flat, roofed and fitted with
shelves and counter, and containing a various assortment
of merchandize, among which were several copper stills,
of which much use is now made throughout the whole western
country for distilling peach and apple brandy, and rye
whiskey.—The store had two owners, who acted both as
boatmen and merchants, and who freely invited us to partake
of a dram with them. They had loaded their flat
at Wheeling, and were dropping down the river, stopping
occasionally wherever they could find a market for their
goods.</p>

<p>At about one o’clock we proceeded on our voyage, passing
on the right Mr. Dilly’s large frame house and fine farm,
round which the river takes a great bend to the westward.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>About five miles and a half below Little Grave creek,
after passing Big Grave creek,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> (which is as {99} inconsiderable
as its namesake notwithstanding its distinguishing
adjective) and Captina island (very small) and after having
stopped for a few minutes at one Baker’s, who answered
our questions with savage moroseness, we passed Captina
creek on the right, emptying into the Ohio through an
extensive bottom, with three mills and several settlements
on it.</p>

<p>A mile lower, on the left is Baker’s station, which has the
appearance of an old settlement.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>About three miles below Captina creek we stopped on the
left at Mr. Cressop’s fine farm. He was on the plantation
overseeing his labourers, but Mrs. Cressop received us
politely. She is young and very handsome, and her employments
of rocking her infant in its cradle while she exercised
her needle, did not diminish any thing of her beauty
or respectability. She is sister in law to Mr. Luther Martin,
a celebrated lawyer of Baltimore.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Cressop owns a thousand acres of land here in one
body, most of it first rate bottom, his cottage is well furnished,
and he has a neat and good garden.</p>

<p>A little lower we passed Woods’s fine island, about a mile
long, and stopped just beyond it at Biddle’s tavern on the
left, at the conflux of Fish creek<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and the Ohio, a mile and
a half below Cressop’s. Biddle keeps a ferry over Fish
creek, which is a fine deep stream, fifty yards wide, running
thirty miles through the country, but having no mills on it
yet.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Biddle are kind and hospitable, decent in
their manners, and reasonable in their charges. He is a
tenant of Mr. Robert Woods, whose house and extensive
improvements we had passed at Roland’s ferry near Wheeling.</p>

<p>Biddle pays a rent of one hundred dollars per annum, for
which he has a right to cultivate and build wherever he
pleases on Woods’s land, Mr. Woods paying him per valuation
for the buildings. The house he now resides in cost
him six hundred dollars, {100} which he has been repaid.
He has cleared and cultivated the land for some distance
round the house, and he has ten acres in corn on the island,
which contains fifty acres of the first quality of soil above
the highest flood marks, the rest being liable to inundation.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, we landed on the left at John Wells’s,
seven miles from Biddle’s. It was a fine night. Eight or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>nine young men who had been reaping for Wells during the
day, were stretched out at their ease on the ground, round
the door of the cabin, listening to the vocal performance
of one of their comrades, who well merited their attention,
from the goodness of his voice, his taste, execution, variety
and humour. We enjoyed a rural supper, while listening
to the rustick chorister, then resisting our friendly host’s
invitation to accept of a bed, and provided with a light and
some milk for next morning’s breakfast, we retired to our
skiff, threw out a night line to fish, and endeavoured to compose
ourselves to sleep under our awning. We were much
disturbed throughout the night by gnats and musquitoes,
attracted probably by our light, before extinguishing of
which, we killed a winged animal of the fly kind, the largest
of the species I had ever seen. It was about three inches
long, with four gauzy wings, and a most formidable display
of forceps on each side the mouth, like those of a
scorpion, for which reason it might be named not improperly
a winged scorpion, though it is probably not venomous
like it.</p>

<p>Wells and his wife are a young couple who removed last
spring to this place, from his father’s, an opulent farmer,
eighteen miles lower down the river. They are kind and
obliging, and better informed than one might expect, from
their limited opportunities of acquiring knowledge in so
remote a situation. Mrs. Wells, though a delicately formed
woman, and with {101} twin boys only six weeks old, both
of whom she nurses, seemed neither to have, nor to require
any assistance in her domestick employments, yet both
plenty and order were observable throughout her cabin.
Though we were much incommoded here by musquitoes,
yet I must observe, that comparatively with the country
to the eastward of the Allegheny mountains, particularly
near the sea coast, in the vicinity of salt marshes, we found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>very few of those troublesome insects, in our descent of the
Ohio, and though we occasionally heard the unwelcome
hum of a few solitary ones, we never once saw or heard a
swarm of them: we were however sometimes at night, when
sleeping in our skiff, infested by gnats or sand flies, but not
in such numbers as we might have expected on a river in the
warmest season of the year.</p>

1755, removed to the Shenandoah Valley, later to Dunkard’s Creek, and (1781)
to Washington County, Pennsylvania. While there he learned of a projected
Indian attack on the fort at Wheeling, and sent his son Henry, a youth of eighteen,
to deliver the warning. Henry was captured by the Indians, carried to the Sandusky
towns, and only saved at the intercession of Simon Girty. Upon his release
three years later, he found that his father had again removed, and fortified Baker’s
Station near Captina Creek. At the close of the Indian wars, Henry Baker married,

Michael Cresap, died. The latter is well-known in border annals. As early as
1771 he had begun sending out squatters from his home in Old-town, Maryland, to
take up Ohio lands; but he himself did not settle in this vicinity until the spring of
1774, when he immediately became involved in the troubles leading to Lord Dunmore’s
War. He was commissioned captain of the local militia (June 10, 1774),
and joined McDonald’s expedition to the Muskingum towns. The following year
Cresap was again in Maryland, and raised a company for the Continental army,
dying in New York on his way to join Washington at Cambridge. Of his children
the eldest daughter married Luther Martin, the well-known Maryland statesman
and jurist. The youngest son, Michael, settled on his father’s Ohio lands, and
became a wealthy and respected citizen.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>At half past four on Wednesday 22d July, we loosed from
the bank, and drifted down the stream: The banks on both
sides low, and the bottoms very extensive.</p>

<p>At eight we were abreast of Fishing creek on the left
seven miles below Wells’s. It is about the size of Fish
creek, and has a saw mill on it, and at its mouth, one Morgan
has a farm beautifully situated.</p>

<p>{102} At half past eight we overtook Frazey’s boat which
we had passed on the 18th, and which had floated past us
during the night. The sick man had had fits yesterday,
yet neither his wife, his son, nor his brother seemed much
affected with his situation, but spoke of it very carelessly,
though they did not expect him to live twenty-four hours
longer. He had been some years in a declining state, and
perhaps they thought that his death would be convenient
both to them and to himself.</p>

<p>Three miles and a half below Fishing creek, we left
Peyton’s island on the left. It is about a mile and a half
long, and is cultivated and inhabited.—From hence, the
Long reach in its whole length of eighteen miles, the islands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>on the left, the projecting points on the right, and the forest
covered and unequal hills on each side, form a most beautiful
coup d’œil.</p>

<p>Four miles and a half lower, we had passed Williamson’s
island, which is above two miles long, and we stopped
just below it on the left bank, at Charles Wells’s, the sign
of the buck. He is father to John Wells, at whose house
we had supped last night: He has a fine farm, good buildings
and a large tract of land which he bought from a Mr.
Caldwell two or three years ago. We here got a good dinner,
the charge was reasonable, and the family obliging.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells shewed us a remarkable petrifaction of part
of a beech tree, found about twenty miles from his house,
at the other side of the river in the state of Ohio, in a northerly
direction. The tree was found torn up by the root,
which with part of the trunk, was covered by a pool of
stagnate water, and completely petrified, while the part of
the trunk and the limbs which were out of the water, were
still in their original state of wood, but dry, and partly
rotten. We wished to purchase this petrification from
Mr. Wells, but he was too much of a naturalist himself to
part {103} with such a curiosity for a sum which would have
been a temptation to a person of a different taste.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>Passing Pursley’s, Wilson’s and Williamson’s islands,
none of them exceeding a mile in length, we came to the
end of Long reach, eleven miles below Wells’s, where in a
charming situation on the left, is {104} a fine settlement,
commanding a view of the reach and its islands upwards.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Little and Rat islands joined by a sand bar, are only half
a mile long each, and just below them, and three miles from
Long reach, is the beginning of Middle island, which is
two miles and a half long, with three families settled on it.
Middle island creek, after running some distance from its
source in Virginia, turns some mills and falls into the Ohio
at the back of the island. We went to the right of those
islands, and two miles below Middle island, we landed at
squire Green’s tavern on the right, and got supper and
beds.</p>

<p>The squire who derives his title from being a magistrate,
came here from Rhode Island about nine years ago. He has
a fine farm, on an extensive bottom, and he has two sons
settled about a mile back from the river, where they have a
horse-mill and a distillery. Two younger sons and a daughter,
a sensible pleasing young woman, live at home with their
parents. One of the sons was suffering under a fever and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>ague, the first time it had been known in the family—a
proof of the salubrity of the situation, the bottoms and
flats throughout this country being generally subject to
this harassing and enfeebling disorder, which however
diminishes in proportion as the lands are cleared. I recommended
a plentiful use of calomel occasionally, and a strong
decoction of Peruvian bark, snake root and ginseng, during
all the intermissions.</p>

<p>On Thursday 23d July, we proceeded down the river at
five A. M. passing three small islands called the Three
Brothers, between a mile and two miles and a half below
squire Green’s, the two first of which are rather low, but
the third is partly cultivated.—The river, its banks and
islands are very beautiful hereabouts; the hills having
gradually lessened from the south end of the Long reach,
there are none but {105} very moderate risings to be seen
from the river, at twelve miles below squire Green’s, where
I observed on the left a saw for ship plank. Two miles
further, at half past nine, we passed Little Muskingum
river on the right. It is about twenty-five yards wide, and
has a handsome Chinese bridge over it. Dewal’s island
extends from hence two miles and a half to Marietta, where
we landed on the right at eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>This town is finely situated on both banks of the Muskingum,
at the confluence of that river with the Ohio. It is
principally built on the left bank, where there are ninety-seven
houses, including a court-house, a market-house, an
academy, and a post-office. There are about thirty houses
on the opposite bank, the former scite of Fort Harmar,
which was a United States’ garrison during the Indian wars,
but of which no vestige now remains. Some of the houses
are of brick, some of stone, but they are chiefly of wood,
many of them large, and having a certain air of taste. There
are two rope-walks, and there were on the stocks two ships,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>two brigs, and a schooner. A bank is established here,
which began to issue notes on the 20th inst. Its capital
is one hundred thousand dollars, in one thousand shares:
Mr. Rufus Putnam is the president.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The land on which Marietta is built, was purchased
during the Indian war, from the United States, by some
New England land speculators, who named themselves the
Ohio Company. They chose the land facing the Ohio,
with a depth from the river of only from twenty to thirty
miles to the northward, thinking the proximity of the river
would add to its value, but since the state of Ohio has began
to be generally settled, the rich levels in the interior have
been preferred, but not before the company had made large
sales, particularly to settlers from New England, notwithstanding
the greatest part of the tract {106} was broken and
hilly, and the hills mostly poor, compared with those farther
to the westward, on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>Marietta is principally inhabited by New Englanders,
which accounts for the neat and handsome style of building
displayed in it.</p>

<p>The Muskingum is about two hundred yards wide, and
has a rapid current of from three to four miles an hour, by
which a ferry-boat is carried across in something more than
a minute, by a very simple but ingenious piece of machinery.
A rope of five or six inches in circumference is extended
across from bank to bank, and hove taught by a windlass:
two rollers play on it fixed in a box to each end of which the
ends of two smaller ropes are fastened, whose other ends
are led to the two extremities of the ferry flat, and taken
round winches with iron cranks, on which the rope at the
end of the flat which is to be foremost being wound up,
presents the side of the flat to the current at an angle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>about thirty degrees. It is then pushed off—the current
acts upon it, and it arrives at the opposite side in the time
above mentioned.</p>

<p>There is a good road from Marietta, twelve miles up the
bank of the Muskingum to Waterford, which is a good settlement
with some mills, from whence it is continued northerly,
parallel to the general course of the river, to Zanesville,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and the interiour of the state.</p>

<p>About half a mile from Marietta, on the bank of the Muskingum,
are some curious vestiges of Indian fortification.
A parallelogram of seven hundred by five hundred yards is
surrounded by a raised bank of two or three feet high, and
ten or twelve feet broad, with four entrances opposite to
each other on the two longest sides, and opposite to the two
oblong platforms at diagonal corners of the parallelogram
which are raised four or five feet above the surface of the
natural plain. A causeway forty yards wide, and from ten
to twelve feet high, rounded like a turnpike {107} road, leads
from it to the river. Three hundred yards nearer the town
is a mount resembling the monument at Grave creek and
about half its height and size, surrounded by a ditch four
feet deep, through which are two entrances.</p>

<p>We got a good dinner at Monsall’s tavern, where major
Joseph Lincoln,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> to whom I had a letter of introduction,
politely called on us, conversed with us, and gave us much
information; and regretted that our determination to descend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>the river directly after dinner prevented his being favoured
with our company at his house.</p>

<p>Two block houses still remain in Marietta, out of which
it was very unsafe to go singly previous to Wayne’s treaty,
as the Indians were always lurking about, on the watch to
shoot and scalp, when such opportunities were given them,
and in which they were frequently but too successful.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a> The following account of uncommon petrifactions from Georgia and Kentucky,
we copy from the New York Medical Repository, vol. ii, page 415.</p>

<p>“Two rare extraneous fossils have been discovered, one in Georgia and the
other in Kentucky. They have both been presented to Dr Mitchill. The former
was brought by general David Meriwether, from a spring not very distant from the
high shoals of the river Apalachy. It is rather above the size and thickness of a
Spanish dollar, except that it is somewhat gibbous or convex on the upper side.
From the centre proceed five bars, of four rays each, in the direction of radial
lines, but connected by curves before they reach the circumference. On the under
side are five grooves or creases, corresponding with the five radial bars above, one
crease below to four rays above. At the centre beneath is a considerable concavity,
corresponding with the convexity on the outside. There is reason to believe that
it is an <i>echinus</i>, or <i>sea-urchin</i> of which the species are very numerous, some of them
nearly flat, and many are found buried in the earth at great distances from the
ocean.—From the place where this was found, it was computed there were enough,
by estimation, to fill a bushel. And what was very remarkable, they were so
nearly alike that they seemed to have been fashioned in the same mould, and have
not been discovered in any other place.</p>

<p>“The latter of these rarities is from Kentucky. One of them had been received
several years ago from Dr. S. Brown, of Lexington, now of Orleans; and several
others since from Professor Woodhouse. They have a remote resemblance to a
small acorn. At the larger end is a small projection resembling a broken foot-stock.
At the smaller extremity are six indentations, or orifices, which may
be imagined to be the decayed pistils or stigmata of a former blossom. And on
the sides are figured fine sharp-pointed surfaces, having a similitude to the quinquepartite
calyx of a plant. It may be doubted whether this is of animal or vegetable
origin. It also may be reasonably supposed to be a species of <i>echinus</i>.</p>

little importance.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

occurred soon after Cuming’s visit.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="hanging-indent1">Trade wind—Vienna—Belle-prè—Little Kenhawa river—Browning’s
tavern—Blennerhasset’s island, handsome
seat and fine farm.</p>
</div>


<p>At half past two we proceeded from Marietta, accompanied
by a Mr. Fry, a genteel and well informed young
lawyer, from the vicinity of Boston, in search of an establishment
in some part of this new country. We had also as a
passenger, a countryman, by trade a house carpenter, who
resided in Virginia, {108} about fifty miles lower down the
river, and was returning home after a trip up and down the
Muskingum as one of the crew of a keel boat.</p>

<p>There was a fresh S. W. wind, which is a trade wind on the
Ohio every day during summer, generally commencing about
eight o’clock in the morning, and ceasing about five in the
afternoon, during which a boat with a sail could ascend
against the stream, from two to five miles an hour, in proportion
to the force of the wind; on which account I would
recommend it to navigators ascending the Mississippi and
the Ohio in the summer season, to be provided with a sail,
as it will accelerate their voyage very much, besides saving
them a great deal of labour.</p>

<p>It blew so fresh this afternoon, that even with the aid of
our passengers, and a strong favourable current, we could
scarcely make any progress against the wind, which also
occasioned a considerable roughness of the water. By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>dint however of perseverance we advanced a little, passing,
three miles below Marietta, Muskingum island, two
miles long, and uncultivated, and a mile beyond that,
Second island, a fine little uncultivated island, three quarters
of a mile long.</p>

<p>Two miles from hence, we passed on the left, a small
settlement of six or eight cabins, called Vienna, which does
not appear to be flourishing; and half a mile lower on the
right, Coles’s tavern, a very good square roofed house; a
little beyond which is Third island, a mile long, and the beginning
of the fine settlement of Belle-prè on the right, and
a mile lower down, Little Kenhawa river on the left.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
This is a handsome little river, about eighty yards wide,
with a placid stream. It has Wood county court-house, and
a tavern, on the right bank of its embouchure.</p>

<p>We landed on the right at Browning’s tavern,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> a good
house and pleasant situation, almost opposite {109} the
Little Kenhawa. Several travellers sat down with us to an
excellent supper, amongst whom were a merchant from
Lexington, a travelling speculator and well digger from
French Grant, and a Mr. Smith from Cincinnati, who was
deputed by the marshal of Virginia to collect evidence for
the trial of Col. Burr, and his associates at Richmond.</p>

<p>Leaving Browning’s tavern on Friday, 24th July, at six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>o’clock, without our passengers, in twenty minutes after, we
had advanced a mile and three quarters, and landed on the
north side of Blennerhasset’s island, a quarter of a mile
below the eastern end.</p>

<p>On ascending the bank from the landing, we entered at a
handsome double gate, with hewn stone square pilasters, a
gravel walk, which led us about a hundred and fifty paces,
to Mr. Blennerhasset’s house, with a meadow on the left,
and a shrubbery on the right, separated from the avenue
by a low hedge of privy-sally, through which innumerable
columbines, and various other hardy flowers were displaying
themselves to the sun, at present almost their only observer.</p>

<p>We were received with politeness by Mrs. Cushing, whose
husband, Col. Cushing, has a lease of this extensive and well
cultivated farm, where he and his family now reside in
preference to his own farm at Belle-prè.</p>

<p>The house occupies a square of about fifty-four feet each
side, is two stories high, and in just proportion. On the
ground floor is a dining room of twenty-seven feet by twenty,
with a door at each end communicating with two small
parlours, in the rear of each of which is another room, one of
which was appropriated by Mr. B. for holding a chymical
apparatus, and as a dispensary for drugs and medicines.</p>

<p>The stair case is spacious and easy, and leads to a very
handsome drawing room over the dining room, of the same
dimensions. It is half arched round the {110} cornices and
the ceiling is finished in stucco. The hangings above the
chair rail are green with gilt border, and below a reddish
grey. The other four rooms on the same floor correspond
exactly with those below, and are intended either for bed
chambers, or to form a suit with the drawing room.</p>

<p>The body of the house is connected with two wings, by
a semicircular portico or corridor running from each front
corner. In one wing is the kitchen and scullery, and in the
other was the library, now used as a lumber room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>
<p>It is to be regretted that so tasty and so handsome a house
had not been constructed of more lasting materials than
wood.</p>

<p>The shrubbery was well stocked with flowery shrubs
and all the variety of evergreens natural to this climate,
as well as several exoticks, surrounds the garden, and has
gravel walks, labyrinth fashion, winding through it.</p>

<p>The garden is not large, but seems to have had every
delicacy of fruit, vegetable, and flower, which this fine
climate and luxurious soil produces. In short, Blennerhasset’s
island is a most charming retreat for any man of
fortune fond of retirement, and it is a situation perhaps not
exceeded for beauty in the western world. It wants however
the variety of mountain—precipice—cateract—distant
prospect, &amp;c. which constitute the grand and sublime.</p>

<p>The house was finished in a suitable style, but all the
furniture and moveables were attached by the creditors to
whom Mr. B. had made himself liable by endorsing Col.
Burr’s bills, and they were lately sold at publick auction at
Wood county court-house, for perhaps less than one twentieth
of their first cost.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Cushing described Mrs. B. as beautiful and highly
accomplished, about thirty years of age, and mother of two
infant sons now with her at Natchez.</p>

<p>{111} After passing an hour in this delightful spot, we
left it with regret that such a terrestrial paradise should be
deserted by an owner who had taste to blend judiciously
the improvements of art with the beauties of nature. Its
fertility will always ensure its cultivation, but without a
Horace it must cease to be a Tivoli.</p>

<p>Belpré (contraction of Belle Prairie) was the site chosen for the second separate
community of the Ohio Company of Associates, being laid out 1789-90. The
first town meeting was held in 1802. Belpré’s chief title to fame is the fact that
there was established (about 1795) the first circulating library in the Northwest
Territory. The son of Israel Putnam brought out a portion of his father’s library,
and formed a stock company in which shares were sold at ten dollars each. The
company was dissolved (1815 or 1816), and among the stockholders were distributed
the books, some of which are still to be found in the neighboring farmhouses.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> This description of the Blennerhassett place so soon after the family were
forced to abandon the island, is of especial interest. The story of Harman Blennerhassett
is one of the best-known in Western annals. He was an Irish gentleman
of fortune and culture, who because of his republican principles emigrated to America.
In 1798 he bought this beautiful island in the Ohio, and prepared it for a
home for his family. Charming and accomplished, he and his wife occupied themselves
in beautifying the place, in generous and lavish hospitality, and in scientific
investigation. Unfortunately Blennerhassett was tempted to embrace the schemes
of Aaron Burr, and involved his entire estate in that enterprise. Late in 1806
rumors of treason grew so strong that Blennerhassett was obliged to escape from
his island, which was shortly overrun with local militia, who wantonly destroyed
much property and insulted Mrs. Blennerhassett. The place had been left to the
care of Colonel Nathaniel Cushing, who, after distinguished service in the Revolution,
had removed to the Ohio, and having settled near Belpré, was a neighbor and
warm friend of the Blennerhassetts. The fine mansion was burned in 1811 by the
carelessness of negroes, and but little is now left of the estate which had been laid
out with so much care and taste. For description of the present condition of the
island, see Thwaites, <i>On the Storied Ohio</i>.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>


<p>We dropped down the stream gently three miles, to the
end of Blennerhasset’s island, a little beyond which, on the
Ohio shore, we observed a very good looking two story
brick house, which as we had been informed, is an excellent
tavern owned and kept by Mr. Miles, but we were not
tempted to stop, as we had already breakfasted on bread
and milk in our skiff. Two miles and a quarter below
Miles’s we passed Little Hockhocking river on the right.
It is about twenty-five yards wide, and has a wooden bridge
across it, and on its right bank is a large square roofed house,
handsomely situated.</p>

<p>A mile and a half below Little Hockhocking, we saw on
our right a remarkable cavern on the side of a craggy hill,
and four miles lower, having passed Newbury and Mustapha’s
islands, the latter of which is above a mile in length,
and partly cultivated, we came to big Hockhocking river on
the right.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It is only about thirty yards wide at its mouth,
nevertheless it is navigable for keels and other small craft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>{112} nearly seventy miles, a little above which highest point
of navigation, is situated the flourishing town of New
Lancaster.</p>

<p>Two miles and a half below Hockhocking a rivulet called
Lee’s creek, puts in from the Virginia side, and half a mile
further on the same side, is the village of Belleville, or
Belle-prè, finely situated on a high bank, commanding a
good view of the river both ways. There are here only four
or five cabins occupied by hunters and labourers, and a
tolerably good wooden house owned by a Mr. Avery from
New-London in Connecticut, who purchased a tract here
of five miles front on the river, and commenced this settlement
about eleven years ago, but going largely into ship
building, he was so unfortunate in that business, that in
consequence he is now confined for debt in Wood county
gaol.</p>

<p>A Mr. Wild, from Durham in Connecticut, who has been
five years here, resides in Mr. Avery’s house, and cultivates
the farm, which is on a handsome plain running back from
the river, on which he has this season seventy acres of corn
and fifty of wheat, besides a large proportion of meadow.
He was very civil to us, insisting with much hospitality on
our taking some refreshment.</p>

<p>Last fall Mr. Avery’s barn with two thousand bushels
of grain, several stacks of grain, and a horse, grist and saw
mills, were burnt by incendiaries, who, though known, could
not be brought to justice for want of positive proof.</p>

<p>From Little Hockhocking the right bank is hilly and
broken, and the left an extensive bottom; both sides very
thinly inhabited, to ten miles below Belleville, in the last
seven we not having observed a single {113} cabin, though
the land is level and rich. I cannot account for the right
shore not being settled, as it is part of the Ohio Company’s
purchase; but the reason on the Virginia side is, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>heirs of general Washington to whom that valuable tract
descended on his death, ask for it no less than ten dollars
per acre, so that it will probably remain in its savage state
as long as land can be purchased cheaper in its neighbourhood,
notwithstanding its good situation and its excellent
quality.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>After leaving Belleville we saw several bald eagles hovering
about us. They are about the size of large crows, and
when on the wing have their tails spread out in the form of a
crescent.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>About the middle of this uninhabited tract, we observed
on our right a very remarkable large cavern called Devil’s
hole: It is in the face of a rock about half way up a steep hill
close to the river. About fifty rods further on the same hand
we passed Shade river, which is a considerable stream, and
apparently very deep. During the war with the Indians, a
detachment of the Kentucky militia, ascended this river,
landed and destroyed some Indian encampments, but
effected nothing of moment.</p>

<p>Five miles below Shade river, we came to Buffington’s
island, which is partly cultivated and is about two miles
long. Though that on the left is the ship channel, we
chose the one on the right, as it presented a long narrow
vista, which promised the strongest current: We found it
however very shallow, but beautifully picturesque. The
river above the island is about a quarter of a mile wide, but
below, it is contracted to about two hundred yards, and four
miles lower, it is only one hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>Though the river continues narrow, yet probably from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>the depth of its bed the velocity of the current was not
increased for a mile and a quarter further to {114} Peter
Neisanger’s fine farm, where we stopped at half past seven
o’clock.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Fastening our skiff to a tree, we ascended the steep sloping
bank to the house, where we were received with cautious
taciturnity by Mrs. Neisanger, whose ungracious reception
would have induced us to have proceeded further, had not
the evening been too far advanced for us to arrive at better
quarters before dark; and besides the state of our stomachs
rendered us insensible to an uncourteous reception: We
determined therefore to make our quarters good, though
a few minutes after, friend A——, repented of our resolution,
on seeing a figure scarcely meriting the name of human approaching
him, where he had gone alone in quest of some
of the males of the family. It had the appearance of a
man above the middle age, strong and robust, fantastically
covered with ragged cloathing, but so dirty that it was impossible
to distinguish whether he was naturally a white
or an Indian—in either case he equally merited the appellation
of <i>savage</i>. A——, accosted him as lord of the
soil, but he did not deign any reply, on which he returned
to me, where I was in the boat adjusting our baggage, to
consult with me whether we had not better proceed farther;
but first resolving to make one more attempt, we again
mounted the bank and found two men with rifles in
their hands sitting at the door, neither of whose aspects,
nor the circumstance of their being armed, were very
inviting: As however we did not see the strange apparition
which A——, had described to me, we ventured to accost
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>The elder of the two was Neisanger.—Though he did
not say us “<i>nay</i>” to our request of supper, his “<i>yea</i>” was
in the very extreme of <i>bluntness</i>, and without either the
manner or expression which sometimes merits its having
joined to it the adjective <i>honest</i>.</p>

<p>{115} They laid aside their rifles, and supper being announced
by the mistress of the cabin, we made a hearty
meal on her brown bread and milk, while she attended her
self-important lord with all due humility, as Sarah did
Abraham; which patriarchal record in the scriptures, is
perhaps the original cause of a custom which I have observed
to be very common in the remote parts of the United
States, of the wife not sitting down to table until the husband
and the strangers have finished their meal.</p>

<p>During supper, Mr. Neisanger gradually relaxed from
his blunt and cautious brevity of speech, and we gathered
from him that he had been a great hunter and woodsman, in
which occupation, he said that one man may in one season
kill two hundred deer and eighty bears.</p>

<p>He had changed his pursuit of the wild inhabitants of the
forest about nine years ago, for an agricultural life. Since
that time he had cleared a large tract of land, had planted
three thousand fruit trees on his farm, and had carried
on a distillery of whiskey and peach brandy, for the first
of which he gets seventy-five cents per gallon, and for the
last a dollar.</p>

<p>After supper we took leave of this Nimrod of the west
without much regret, as our seats while under his roof had
not been the most easy to us, and we returned to our boat
with more pleasure than we had done heretofore.</p>

<p>We betook ourselves to rest on our platform, lulled to
repose by the mournful hooting of the owl, whose ill omened
note was amply compensated for by the delightful melody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>of the red bird, who awoke us at early dawn with his grateful
welcome to the returning day.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>From hence to Clarksburgh in Virginia is only seventy-five
miles.</p>

panick—Some of the customs of the backwoodsmen—Their
fondness for, and mode of fighting—Their disregard

</div>


<p>Proceeding on Saturday 25th July at 5 in the morning—at
six we were three miles below Neisanger’s, abreast of
Old-town creek on the right, and a floating mill owned by an
Irishman named Pickets. These kind of mills are of a
very simple construction—the whole machinery being in a
flat, moored to the bank, and the stones being put in motion
by the current. They have but little power, not being
capable of grinding more than from fifteen to twenty bushels
of wheat per day.</p>

<p>We were here hailed by two men who offered to work
their passage to the falls. We took them on board, and one
proved to be one Buffington, son to the owner of Buffington’s
island, from whom Pickets had purchased his farm
and mill, and the other was an eccentrick character, being
an old bachelor, without any fixed place of abode, residing
sometimes with one farmer and sometimes with another, between
Marietta and Galliopolis, and making a good deal
of money by speculating in grain, horses, hogs, cattle, or
any thing he can buy cheap and sell dear.</p>

<p>Buffington was a very stout young man, and was going
to the falls to attend a gathering (as they phrase it in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>country) at a justice’s court, which squire Sears, who
resides at the falls, holds on the last Saturday of every month:
He supposed there would be sixty or seventy men there—some
plaintiffs, and some defendants in causes of small
debts, actions of defamation, assaults, &amp;c. and some to
wrestle, fight, {117} shoot at a mark with the rifle for wagers,
gamble at other games, or drink whiskey. He had his rifle
with him and was prepared for any kind of frolick which
might be going forward. He was principally induced to
go there from having heard that another man who was to
be there, had said that he could <i>whip</i> him (the provincial
phrase for beat.) After his frolick was ended he purposed
returning home through the woods.</p>

<p>He related a laughable story of a panick which seized
the people of his neighbourhood about two years ago, occasioned
by a report being spread that two hundred Indians
were encamped for hostile purposes on the banks of Shade
river.</p>

<p>The Pickets’s and some others not accustomed to Indian
war, forted themselves, and hired Buffington to go and
reconnoitre. He hunted, and, to use his own language,
<i>fooled</i> in the woods three or four days; then returned late in
the evening to his own house, and discharged his two rifles,
giving the Indian yell after each, which so terrified the party
forted at Pickets’s, that the centinels threw down their
rifles, and ran into the river up to the belts of their hunting
shirts. The whole party followed—crossed the Ohio in
canoes, and alarmed the Virginia side by reporting that
Buffington’s wife, and some others, who had not been forted,
were shot and scalped by the Indians; but when the truth
came out, they were much ashamed.</p>

<p>Buffington deals in cattle and hogs, which he occasionally
drives to the south branch of the Potomack, where they find
a ready market for the supply of Baltimore and the sea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>coast. The common price here is about three dollars per
cwt.</p>

<p>Two or three years ago when bear skins were worth from
six to ten dollars each, he and another man killed one hundred
and thirty-five bears in six weeks.</p>

<p>{118} It may not be improper to mention, that the backwoodsmen,
as the first emigrants from the eastward of the
Allegheny mountains are called, are very similar in their
habits and manners to the aborigines, only perhaps more
prodigal and more careless of life. They depend more on
hunting than on agriculture, and of course are exposed
to all the varieties of climate in the open air. Their cabins
are not better than Indian wigwams. They have frequent
meetings for the purposes of gambling, fighting and drinking.
They make bets to the amount of all they possess. They
fight for the most trifling provocations, or even sometimes
without any, but merely to try each others prowess, which
they are fond of vaunting of. Their hands, teeth, knees,
head and feet are their weapons, not only boxing with their
fists, (at which they are not to be compared for dexterity,
to the lower classes in the seaports of either the United
States, or the British islands in Europe) but also tearing,
kicking, scratching, biting, gouging each others eyes out
by a dexterous use of a thumb and finger, and doing
their utmost to kill each other, even when rolling over one
another on the ground; which they are permitted to do by
the byestanders, without any interference whatever, until
one of the parties gives out, on which they are immediately
separated, and if the conqueror seems inclined to
follow up his victory without granting quarter, he is generally
attacked by a fresh man, and a pitched battle between
a single pair often ends in a battle royal, where all
present are engaged.</p>

<p>A stranger who had kept aloof during a fray of this kind,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>when it was over, seeing a man with the top of his nose bit
off, he approached him and commiserated his misfortune.
“Don’t pity me,” said the noseless hero, “pity that fellow
there,” pointing with one hand to another who had lost
an eye, and {119} shewing the eye which he held triumphantly
in the other.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>{120} Eight miles below Old-town creek we were carried
through Le Tart’s falls at the rate of six knots an hour, but
the rapid, which it ought to be called more properly than
falls, is not more than half a mile long.</p>

<p>Captain or squire Sears’s house, opposite to which we
landed our passengers, is very pleasantly situated on the
left shore, commanding a view of two islands above the
falls, the nearest one in cultivation,—the opposite shore
variegated with low hills and valleys, woods, cultivated
fields and farm houses, a new water mill which he is building
on the right bank of the rapid, and the river below,
taking a sudden bend from N. W. to N. E. by N.</p>

<p>A mile and a half lower down we observed a large barge
on the stocks in the woods on the right bank.</p>

<p>Four miles from the falls we came to Graham’s station,
which is a fine populous settlement, extending about three
miles along the left bank of the river, from West creek to
Wolfe’s farm house, which is charmingly situated on a cliff.
The Ohio side opposite is also well settled.</p>

<p>On passing Wolfe’s we asked a man at the door who
it was that lived there: He informed us, and {121} civilly
invited us to land and quench our thirst at a fine spring
on the beach; but we declined stopping, as we had filled
our water cask at Pickets’s mill.</p>

<p>There is a ferry across the Ohio about the middle of
Graham’s station, which connects a road from Big to Little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>Kenhawa, sixteen miles to the former and thirty to the latter.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Nine miles below Wolfe’s, Jones’s rocks, on a hill on the
right have a striking appearance. They are of freestone,
bare, and heaped upon each other, resembling some of the old
Turkish fortifications so numerous in the Levant.</p>

<p>On a small bottom between them and the river, in a very
romantick situation, is a farm, seven years old, belonging
to a Mr. Jones, who informed us that there is a vein of good
coal about a quarter of a mile from his house.</p>

<p>This was the first house we had observed for the last eight
miles, though the land on the Virginia side, owned by one
Waggoner, seems to be of the first quality.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">[95]</a> This indeed is a most lamentable picture of the depravity of human nature,
and might have applied better fifteen or twenty years ago than at present. But
our author ought to have confined it to a <i>particular</i> frontier, and to a <i>few</i> individuals;
for it is by no means the character of <i>all</i> our backwoodsmen, nor are such ferocious
and more than beast-like battles customary on the borders of all our frontier settlements.
Nor can we believe even the more profligate among the class here spoken
of, would <i>purposely</i> meet (unless indeed in an actual state of warfare) to fight, to
gouge, and to tear each others flesh to pieces in the manner described; but that
fighting, gouging, &amp;c. might be the <i>consequence</i> of such meetings and carousings, we
have little doubt, especially where whiskey is the common drink of the country.
There are always a few diabolically wicked in all societies of men, rude or civilized;
but it would be unjust to libel a <i>whole</i> community because of the wickedness and
profligacy of a <i>few</i>.</p>

<p>It is observable that European travellers frequently misrepresent us by giving
for a <i>general</i> character, that which is <i>particular</i>; hence they mislead their readers
into the most monstrous blunders as respects the true features of our national
character, while they do us a greater piece of injustice than they might have intended.
As an instance of this the following quotation from “<i>Volney’s View of
the United States</i>,” will suffice: Speaking of the Philadelphia mode of eating and
drinking, he observes:</p>

<p>“At breakfast they deluge the stomach with a pint of hot water, slightly impregnated
with tea, or slightly tinctured, or rather coloured, with coffee; and they
swallow, almost without mastication, hot bread, half baked, soaked in melted
butter, with the grossest cheese, and salt or hung beef, pickled pork or fish, all
which can with difficulty be dissolved.</p>

<p>“At dinner they devour boiled pastes, called, absurdly, puddings, garnished
with the most luscious sauces. Their turnips and other vegetables are floated in
lard or butter. Their pastry is nothing but a greasy paste, imperfectly baked.
To digest these various substances, they take tea, <i>immediately after dinner</i>, so
strong that it is bitter to the taste, as well as utterly destructive of the nervous system.
Supper presently follows, with salt meat and shell fish in its train. Thus
passes the whole day, in heaping one indigestive mass upon another. To brace the
exhausted stomach, wine, rum, gin, malt spirits, or beer, are used with dreadful
prodigality.”</p>

<p>I am a native American, have passed through most of the American states, and
never drank, nor saw drunk, at either publick or private table, “<i>tea immediately
after dinner</i>,” nor never heard of a practice of the kind in any of the states, hence I
think I have reason to conclude Mr. Volney <i>erroneous</i> in giving this as the <i>general</i>
custom of a people; and think it probable he drew his conclusions from the <i>particular</i>
practice of a <i>few</i> families, in which he might have lodged; and which might have
altered their usual mode of eating and drinking, in order to accommodate the supposed
habits of this great traveller, he being a native of France, where it is well-known
coffee is much used after dinner. How much more would the publick
be benefitted by the remarks of travellers on the manners and customs of countries,
would they divest themselves of their prejudices, passions, and partialities, and
confine themselves to the relation of simple truths. Methinks a traveller who intends
to publish his travels, ought to be a <i>philosopher</i>, in the true sense of the
word.—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

<p>Two miles and a half below Jones’s is Leading creek,
a beautiful little river with high sloping banks on the right,
and just below it a Mr. Kerr has a good log house, and a
garden with a handsome stoccado {122} fence, behind which
is a small cleared farm. A vein of coal is said to be on the
Virginia side opposite, not much approved of by the blacksmiths,
probably because not wrought deep enough. Three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>miles further on the right is a very good, new, two story
house, clapboarded, and painted white, and a large horse
mill; and half a mile lower on the opposite shore is a large
unfinished house, lately purchased by a Mr. Long from
Col. Clendinning, who began to build it nine years ago.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
It resembles a church, and is not only a good feature in the
prospect, but impresses the traveller with lively ideas of the
advanced state of population of the neighbouring country.—Close
to it is a small hamlet, or quarter, of a few cabins, the
whole in a beautiful situation on a high bank commanding
a view of Eight Mile island, just below, and both banks of
the river, which are here well inhabited and very pleasant.</p>

<p>Two miles lower is Six Mile island, very small, and half
a mile beyond it on the left is a house most delightfully
situated, commanding the whole vista of the river seven
miles up to Leading creek, with the two intermediate
islands. The house is sheltered from the northern blasts
of winter by a fine grove purposely left standing, when the
surrounding farm was cleared.</p>

<p>I observed that in general, from Le Tart’s falls, trees
were left standing very tastily in places where they can have
a good or pleasing effect, particularly the gigantick beeches
along the margin of the river.</p>

<p>About a mile lower down, we met a large canoe, paddled
against the stream by five well drest young men, while a
respectable looking elderly man steered. They had five
very smart looking girls with them, and, from their gaiety,
were apparently returning from some <i>frolick</i>—the epithet
used in this country for all neighbourly meetings for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>purpose of assisting each other in finishing some domestick
or farming {123} business, which generally conclude with
feasting and dancing, which sometimes lasts two or three
days, and is not seldom the fruitful source of many a tender
and lasting connexion.</p>

<p>Near this we perceived a stratum of slate over one of coal,
but the latter too much under the level of the river to be
wrought. The slate stratum extends several rods, and is
topped and squared as if done by art.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to remark that all strata throughout
the whole of this western country, have been hitherto found
to be horizontal.</p>

<p>The banks from hence four miles to Point Pleasant are
apparently rich with good bottoms on both sides, yet but
thinly inhabited.</p>

<p>Point Pleasant, where we arrived at seven o’clock in the
evening, is beautifully situated on a bank, at least forty
feet above the common level of the Ohio, at the conflux of
the Great Kenhawa with that river. It contains twenty-one
indifferent houses, including a court-house of square logs,
this being the seat of justice of Mason county. The town
does not thrive on account of the adjacent country not settling
so fast as the opposite side in the state of Ohio, where
lands can be bought in small tracts for farms, by real settlers,
at a reasonable rate, whereas the Virginia lands belonging
mostly to wealthy and great landholders, are held at
four or five times the Ohio price.</p>

<p>The river Ohio is here six hundred yards wide, and the
Kenhawa is two hundred and twenty-five, the latter navigable
about eighty miles to the falls.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October, 1774, a battle was fought here by
the Virginia and Pennsylvania militia under general Lewis,
against the Indians, who had attacked them in great force,
but were defeated and compelled to retreat across the Ohio,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>carrying their dead and wounded with them according to
their invariable custom; as, like the ancient Greeks, they
deem it an {124} irreparable disgrace, to leave the unburied
bodies of their slain fellow warriours to the disposal of the
victorious enemy. The Americans bought their victory at
the expense of a number of their most active men, amongst
whom was Col. Lewis, brother to the general, a brave and
enterprizing officer. They were buried near the edge of the
river bank, which has since mouldered away, occasionally
discovering their remains to the present inhabitants, who
have always re-interred them.</p>

<p>This was a military station above thirty years ago. It is
twenty years since it was laid out for a town, but it had no
houses erected in consequence until after Wayne’s Indian
treaty, it being unsafe before to live outside the stoccado.</p>

<p>Lord Dunmore, who was then governour of Virginia, and
commander-in-chief on the expedition against the Indians,
at the time of the battle of Point Pleasant, had penetrated
by the way of Wheeling across the Ohio, to within a short
march of their principal settlement, near where Chilicothe
now is; when, instead of following up Lewis’s success,
while they were yet under the influence of the panick occasioned
by it, and by his lordship’s approach with the main
body of the militia, and of exterminating them, or of driving
them out of the country, he received their submission and
patched up a treaty with them, which they observed no
longer than during the short time that he continued with a
military force in their country, for which he was much blamed
by the back settlers and hunters. Humanity, however,
must plead his excuse with every thinking or philosophick
mind; and volumes might be written to prove the justice
of the Indian cause; but in all national concerns, it has
never been controverted by the history of mankind from
the earliest ages of which we have any record, but that interest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>and power always went hand in hand to serve the
mighty against the {125} weak, and writers are never wanting
to aid the cause of injustice, barbarity and oppression,
with the sophistry of a distorted and unnatural philosophy;
while the few who would be willing to espouse the rights of
the feeble, have not enough of the spirit of chivalry, to
expose themselves to an irreparable loss of time, and the
general obloquy attending an unpopular theme: even in
this so much boasted land of liberty and equality, where
nothing is to be dreaded from the arbitrary acts of a king
and council during a suspension of a habeas corpus law,
or the mandate of an arbitrary hero in the full tide of victory.</p>

<p>Is not popular opinion frequently as tyrannical as star
chambers, or lettres de cachets?</p>

<p>The Indians north of the Ohio, under the name of the
Five Nations, and their dependants, had been gradually, but
rapidly, forced back more and more remote from the country
of their ancestors, by the irresistible and overswelling tide
of population of Europeans and their descendants. They
at last abandoned all the continent of America east of the
great chain of the Allegheny mountains, to the enlightened
intruders, and besides that natural barrier, they added an
immense wilderness of nearly five hundred miles in breadth,
west of those mountains, to the space which divided them;
settling themselves in that country which has since become
the state of Ohio, having Lake Erie for its northern boundary,
and the river Ohio for its southern. The woods and
savannahs to the southward of that river abounded in
game, such as buffaloes, deer, elk, bears, and innumerable
smaller animals, valuable for their flesh, skins, and furs.
They were tempted to make hunting excursions into this
country, during which they frequently met with parties of
hunters of other Indian nations, called Chocktaws, Chickasaws,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>and Cherokees, who resided far south of it, but who
had been accustomed to consider it as their exclusive property
{126} for hunting in, from time immemorial. Battles
with various success were generally the consequence of
those meetings. The southern Indians were the most
numerous—the northern the most warlike.</p>

<p>Finding that they exhausted each other to no purpose,
by such constant hostility, necessity at last obliged them to
make a peace, the basis of which was, that the hunting
country should be common to both as such, to the exclusion
of all other people, and that neither would ever settle on it
themselves, nor permit others to do so.</p>

<p>They enjoyed in quiet the uninterrupted use of this immense
common forest, for many years after; but the Virginians
having extended their settlements to the westward of
the mountains, the frontier inhabitants, who, like the aborigines,
supported themselves principally by hunting, were
led in quest of game, as far west as the banks of Kentucky
river, in the very centre of the Indian hunting country.</p>

<p>On their return to their settlements, the report spread
from them to the colonial government, that they had discovered
a country most abundant in game, and far exceeding
in natural fertility any of the settled parts of Virginia.</p>

<p>Small armed parties were sent out to establish blockhouses
for the protection of hunters or settlers, while the
lands were divided into tracts and granted or sold to proprietors,
as suited the convenience of the government.</p>

<p>The Indians, indignant at being followed to so remote a
part of the continent, after the great sacrifice to peace
before made by them in the abandonment of their native
country, did their utmost to repel the invaders. The
northern tribes were the most ferocious and the most exasperated,
and sometimes alone, and sometimes aided by
their southern auxiliaries, carried on a most bloody and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>exterminating war against all the whites who had the
temerity to brave {127} their decided and fixed determination
to adhere to their mutual guarantee of their hunting grounds.</p>

<p>Much blood was shed on both sides, and many parties
of the whites were cut off, but their perseverance at last
prevailed, and Kentucky became one of the United States
of America.</p>

<p>The negro who carried our baggage from the boat to the
tavern, regretted much that we had not arrived a little
earlier in the day, to get some of the people’s money who
had been assembled at a gathering. On our inquiring
“how”—he replied by asking if we were not <i>play-actors</i>,
and if we had not got our <i>puppetshew things</i> in some of the
trunks and boxes we had with us. He had probably conceived
this idea from our having in the skiff a large box of
medicines, which we had taken in at Marietta for a doctor
Merrit at French Grant, and besides we had more baggage
than it was usual for him to see carried by travellers, who
had occasion to stop at Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>Our landlord’s name was John Allen, a young man, who
had lived here since his infancy twenty years.—On a late
journey to Richmond he had married a young woman there,
who sat at supper with us, but who seemed to wish to appear
rather above the doing the honours of a tavern table. He
had lately been chosen one of the members of the legislature
for Mason county, and seemed fond of discussing politicks,
but apparently more for the sake of information, than
for insisting <i>dogmatically</i>, according to the prevailing mode,
on any opinion of his own. In short, he seemed to regret
the blind illiberality of the improperly self-termed federalists,
and of their equally prejudiced democratick antagonists,
and seemed desirous of meriting the character of a disinterested
patriot, and a federal republican in its real and
literal sense, without perhaps understanding either term.</p>

<p>On Sunday 26th July, we left Point Pleasant, and passing
Great Kenhawa river on our left, and Galliopolis island,
half a mile long on the right, at 7 we landed on the Ohio
side, at Galliopolis four miles below Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>We found at the landing a keel loaded with lead from
Kaskaskias on the Mississippi;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It was worked by eight
stout Canadians, all naked, except a breech clout. They
are the descendants of the original French settlers, and they
resemble the Indians both in their manners and customs, and
complexion; which last is occasioned by their being exposed
naked to all weathers from their infancy; which also
renders them very hardy, and capable of enduring much
fatigue. They are temperate in the use of spiritous liquors,
while engaged in any laborious employment, but they must
be fed with double the quantity of food which would suffice
American or English labourers. The meat which they prefer
is bacon or salt pork, of which they use daily about four
pounds each man, besides bread and potatoes.</p>

<p>They are preferred to any other description of people
for navigating the craft on the rivers in this country, being
patient, steady, and trusty, and never deserting their boats
until their engagement is fulfilled, which the American
boatmen frequently do.</p>

<p>We got an excellent breakfast at Mr. Menager’s, a French
emigrant, who keeps a tavern and a store of very well assorted
goods, which he goes yearly to Baltimore to purchase.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>He is a native of Franche {129} Comté, and his
wife is from Burgundy. They are very civil and obliging,
and have a fine family. It is fifteen years since they arrived
in this country, together with nearly 800 emigrants from
France, of whom only about twenty families now remain at
Galliopolis; the rest having either returned to France,
descended the Ohio to French Grant, proceeded to the
banks of the Mississippi, or fallen victims to the insalubrity
of the climate, which however no longer, or only partially
exists, as it has gradually ameliorated in proportion to the
progress of settlement.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Menager has a curious machine for drawing water from
his well forty or fifty feet deep, and which will answer equally
well for any depth. He got the model from Mr. Blennerhasset.
As I am not mechanick enough to give an adequate
description of it, I shall only remark, that it is equally
simple and ingenuous, and saves much labour; the full
bucket flying up and emptying itself into a small wooden
cistern, while the empty bucket sinks at the same time into
the well, and that without being obliged to work a winch as
in the common mode, where wells are too deep for pumps.</p>

<p>In Galliopolis there are about fifty houses all of wood,
in three long streets parallel to the river, crossed at right
angles by six shorter ones, each one hundred feet wide.
A spacious square is laid out in the centre, on which they
are now making brick to build a court-house for Gallia
county.</p>

<p>During a walk through the town after breakfast, we were
civilly accosted by an old man at the door of the most western
house, who invited us to enter and rest ourselves. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>named Marion, and with his old wife, reminded me of Baucis
and Philemon, or of Darby and Joan. They came here with
the first emigrants from Burgundy—bought some town
lots, on which they planted fruit trees, and converted into
corn fields, as they could not procure tenants {130} nor purchasers
to build on them. They have no children—they
seem much attached to each other, and are healthy, and
content with their situation.—They insisted with much
hospitality on our tasting the old lady’s manufacture of
cherry bounce, before they knew that we could converse
with them in their native tongue; but, when they found that
we could not only do so, but that I could make a subject of
conversation of their own country, and even of their own
province, from having visited it long since they had bid it a
final adieu—it was with difficulty they would permit us to
leave them, before we had spent at least one day with them.
Indeed I never saw the amor patriæ more strongly manifested,
than in the fixed and glistening eyes, which they
rivetted on my face, whilst I described the present state of
their provincial capital Dijon.</p>

<p>Galliopolis abounds with fruit, to the planting of which,
French settlers always pay great attention; but the town
does not thrive, although very pleasantly situated on an
extensive flat.</p>

<p>Pursuing our voyage at ten o’clock, half a league below
Galliopolis, we passed a skiff containing a family, the head
of which was a carpenter and farmer from Baltimore, going
to Green river about five hundred miles lower down.</p>

<p>At two o’clock we had rowed fourteen miles, having
passed Racoon island and creek on the right, during which
the bottom was so extensive on each side, that we could not
see the tops of the river hills over the banks. We were
here charmed with the melody of the red birds responding
to each other from the opposite banks, particularly on passing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>Racoon island. Our exercise having given us an appetite,
we landed and dined under a shady bank on the right,
opposite to a creek, which from that circumstance, and its
not being noticed in our chart or Navigator, we named
Meridian creek.</p>

<p>{131} Here we began to see again the tops of the low
river hills on the right, but on the left the extensive bottom
still continued, notwithstanding which the settlements are
very thinly scattered, especially for the last eight miles.</p>

<p>At half past two we were abreast of Eighteen mile creek
on the right, so called from its being that distance from
Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>Five miles from where we dined is Swan creek, a handsome
rivulet on the right, and Mercer’s bottom, a fine settlement
on the left, and a mile further, it is separated from
Green’s bottom by the Little Guiandot, a beautiful small
river.</p>

<p>Green’s bottom settlements, which are very fine and populous,
extend along the left bank three miles, and a mile
beyond them the river hills approaching within a quarter
of a mile of the bank, a remarkable cliff called the Hanging
rock, impends from about half their height, and they
again recede. On the right opposite to Hanging rock,
is a bank of clay under which is a substratum of fine potter’s
clay.</p>

<p>It is two miles from Green’s bottom to the next settlement.
A gust threatening, we stopped to shelter at it—but
the house was locked up, and no one at home. Every
thing here testified to its being an honest neighbourhood,
as the smoke-house was left open, with a quantity of fine
bacon in it—a crib was full of corn, and shirts and jackets
were left drying on the garden fence.</p>

<p>After the shower, we went on three miles to Miller’s
farm house at the mouth of Federal creek on the right,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>where we landed and bought some salt pork for stores, and
some milk for supper. Miller seems to be active and industrious,
and keeps a keel boat for freighting on the river,
but he says he gets very little encouragement.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>It was now half past six, and in an hour and three quarters
we rowed eight miles further, when it coming {132} on dark,
and I not being willing to lose the view of any part of the
river, we stopped at Joel Bowden’s tavern and farm on
the right, contrary to A——’s wish of letting the boat float
down the current all night. Though we had provided our
supper, yet we preferred ordering one at Bowden’s, for the
sake of whiling away a little time, and gaining information
about the country.</p>

<p>He had removed his family here from Marietta in April
1806, and had to begin to clear away the forest to make
room for a cabin, and he now has twelve acres completely
cut, grubbed and smooth, and eight acres cut, but not
grubbed, all planted and under fence, besides a natural
orchard of sugar maple of seven acres, out of which he has
cleared every thing else except about four hundred sugar
trees, which will be enough to supply his family with sugar.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>{133} He has also planted an apple and peach orchard
and a nursery, and will cut six tons of hay this year. Such
instances of industry and perseverance are frequently seen
in this country amongst the New England settlers, of which
Bowden is one, who are generally remarkably enterprising,
and judiciously economical. His house not promising
superior accommodation for sleep to our skiff, we re-embarked
after supper, and on our platform enjoyed undisturbed
repose, until five o’clock next morning, when we
loosed from the bank, and proceeded at our usual rate of
from three to four miles an hour.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> Would it not be a wise and prudent foresight in the present generation, in
order that posterity might continue to enjoy the product of this invaluable tree,
to plant orchards of them on the sides of untillable hills and other vacant grounds
of little or no use? They might become a source of considerable wealth, in the
course of twenty or thirty years, when the country gets thickly populated, and the
trees made scarce from the present plan of destroying them in clearing of the lands.
The expense of setting out an orchard of 500 or 1000 trees on each plantation,
might cost, say, twenty-five cents each tree, together with the interest of the money
for thirty years, at which period they would be worth about one dollar per year
for about fifty or a hundred years thereafter. The following observations on the
Maple tree, we copy from Dr. <i>Mease’s</i> “<i>Geological account of the United States</i>:”</p>

<p>“The genus <i>acer</i>, or maple, is useful for various purposes. The <i>a. negundo</i>, or
white or ash leaved maple, is much used in cabinet work, being firm and smooth,
takes a fine polish, and stain. The <i>a. rubrum</i>, or scarlet maple, when sawed into
boards, exhibits the most beautiful waving appearance, and makes articles of furniture
equal to satin wood. A species of maple abounds in Nova Scotia, and no
doubt, farther south, called bird-eye maple, which also is very beautiful. But the
<i>a. saccharinum</i>, or sugar maple, ranks in the first importance among our forest
trees. This valuable native is peculiarly dear to the citizens of this country, as
it furnishes an article of the first necessity, by the labour of free men, and of equal
quality, to that produced by the sugar cane; and the timber is highly useful for
various mechanical purposes, particularly for saddle trees. From the maple may
also be made a pleasant molasses, an agreeable beer, a strong sound wine, and an
excellent vinegar.</p>

<p>“The following facts upon the flowing of maple-juice, are curious, and deserve
investigation.</p>

<p>“The flowing of maple-juice is as completely <i>locked up</i> by continued warmth
as by frost, and only flows by the alternate operation of these agents. Yet the
same degrees of heat, even after frost, have not always the same effect. Thus, a
warm south wind stops the flowing more than a cool north-west wind. To judge
from sensations, generally a bracing wind facilitates the discharge, and a relaxing
wind acts to the contrary. Whether, or how far, electricity may operate in this
case, must be left for future inquirers to determine. The juice flows for about
twenty-four hours after a frost; but, when a tapped tree has ceased, tap a new tree,
and it will flow considerably, as if a certain quantity was discharged by the frost.
The juice flows from all sides of the incision.</p>

<p>“Cut a sugar maple early in the morning, if the night has been cold, and it
will appear comparatively dry and devoid of juice, in every part of the tree. Cut
it a few hours after, if the day is moderately warm, and the juice will issue almost
in streams.”—<span class="smcap">Cramer.</span></p>

<p>Six miles below Bowden’s, we passed Big Guiandot river
which joins the Ohio from the left, and is about eighty yards
wide, having one Buffington’s finely situated house and
farm on the bank just below it. From Bowden’s to Big
Guiandot, the banks of the Ohio are well settled on both
sides. In the next eleven miles, we passed three creeks on
the right, and one on the left hand, the second one called
Indian Guiandot, only worth remarking. It coming on to
rain very heavy, we stopped here at the end of eleven miles,
just above the mouth of a fine little river on the left called
Twelve Pole creek, about thirty yards wide, with a ferry and
a large scow or flat for carrying over horses or cattle. The
house we stopped at was very well situated on the top of a
high sloping bank, and was the residence of one Crumps,
who had removed here from Kentucky, and possessed the
rich and well cultivated surrounding farm. The family
were at breakfast, but no place was offered at the table to
the wet travellers, though it was well loaded with viands,
which Mr. Crumps apparently knew how to make the best
use of for fattening, as his corpulency and general appearance
strongly indicated a propensity to boorish gluttony.
Indeed we were not permitted to enter the eating room, but
with a sort of sullen civility, were desired to sit down in an
open space which divides two enclosed ends from each other,
but all covered with the same roof, and which is the usual
style of the cottages in this part of the country. The space
in the middle is probably {135} left unenclosed, for the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>agreeable occupancy of the family during the violent heats
of summer.</p>

<p>I have observed that wherever we have stopped on the
banks of the river, we have rarely experienced that hospitality,
which might be expected to prevail amongst people so
remote from polished society.</p>

<p>Two hunters sat down with us after they had finished
their breakfast, and they entertained us above an hour with
their feats of deer and bear killing, in which the one always
related something more extraordinary than the other. At
last they bantered each other to go out and kill a deer.</p>

<p>It still rained very heavy, but nothing deterred by it,
they each took their rifle, stuck their tomahawks into the
belts of their hunting shirts, and accompanied by a fine dog,
led by a string to prevent his breaking (or hunting the game
beyond the reach of their rifles) they set off for the woods.</p>

<p>Seeing some cotton regularly planted on the opposite
side of the river, on inquiry, I learned that from hence down
the Ohio, a good deal of cotton is raised, although on account
of its not standing the winter, it must be planted every
year. Though the climate farther south is more congenial
to it, it is nevertheless an annual throughout the continent
to the northward of Cape Florida, differing from the countries
between the tropicks, where I have sometimes seen
the same plants bear to the seventh year; but that only in
places where it was neglected, as the common usage there
is to replant every third or fourth year. A few miles from
Crumps’s there is a large gin worked by two men, which
can clean seven hundred pounds per day; the toll for ginning
is one eighth of the quantity cleaned.</p>

<p>The copperhead snake<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> abounds here, but the rattlesnake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>is scarce. Crumps told us that the bark of the root
of the poplar, particularly the yellow poplar, made into a
strong decoction and taken inwardly, {136} while a part
pounded and applied to the bite of any snake, is an infallible
remedy: And that it is also a most powerful alterative, and
purifier of the blood.</p>

<p>There being no prospect of the rain subsiding, at eleven
o’clock we proceeded, sitting under our awning and letting
the boat drop with the current, which she did about two
miles an hour.</p>

<p>At half past twelve we passed Great Sandy river on the
left, four miles below Crumps’s. It is about a hundred
yards wide, and is the boundary between Virginia and Kentucky;
in the latter of which, on the bank above the confluence,
are two large houses, one of logs and the other
framed and clapboarded, with a sign post before the door—probably
the scite of some future town.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Three miles from hence are two small creeks opposite
each other, and a good brick house building at the mouth
of that on the left. Three miles and a half further is Big
Storm creek on the right, a mile and a half below which,
we passed on the left, an excellent house of a Mr. Colvin,
nearly opposite to which, on the right is a small insulated
mountain named Hanging Rock, from its being a bare perpendicular
rock, from half the elevation to the top.</p>

<p>This is a very picturesque and agreeable object to the
eye, fatigued with the perpetual sameness of the banks below
Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>Two miles further on the right, a little way below Ferguson’s
sand bar, we observed a wharf or pier of loose paving
stones, and some mill machinery on the bank above it—the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>remains of a floating mill carried away last winter by the
floods.</p>

<p>Half a mile below this is a remarkable point, and fine
beach of coarse gravel on the right, and a delightfully
situated farm almost opposite.</p>

<p>Judge Boon has a good house on the left about three miles
further down,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> opposite to which on the Ohio side is the
beginning of French Grant.</p>

<p>{137} The Ohio which had ran generally between the
south and west, (except for about thirty miles near Le Tart’s
falls where it takes a northerly course) had altered its direction
to the north westward, from the confluence of Big
Sandy river.</p>

scene occasioned by it—Mons Gervais and Burrsburgh—Greenupsburgh—Power

Sciota river—Portsmouth—Paroquets.</p>
</div>


<p>A little below judge Boon’s we were hailed by a man
on the Ohio shore. We landed and found him to be a Mr.
White, who had put a box of medicines into our boat at
Marietta, for doctor Merrit, and having travelled on horseback
had arrived here before us.</p>

<p>We now delivered it to White, who, hearing A—— call
me Doctor, he requested me to stop and visit a Mr. Hunt,
who with two of his men and his housekeeper, were suffering
under a most severe epidemick malady, which was then
raging in and about French Grant, and which doctor Merrit,
the only medical man in the settlement, had been attacked
with yesterday. Prompted by humanity, we walked to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>the cabin occupied by Mr. Hunt’s family, where we beheld
a truly distressing scene. In an Indian grass hammock,
lay Mr. Hunt, in a desperate and hopeless stage of the yellow
fever; his skin and eyes of a deep yellow, and he in a state
of apparent stupor, but still sensible. His housekeeper,
looking almost as ill, and groaning piteously, on a bed near
him. One of his men seated on a chair, in a {138} feeble
state of convalescence; and another standing by almost
recovered, but still looking wretchedly. On the floor were
travelling trunks, cases, books, furniture, and house utensils,
promiscuously jumbled together, but all clean, as was
the cabin itself.</p>

<p>I could not help contrasting in my mind Mr. Hunt’s
present situation, at so great a distance from his connexions,
from cultivated society, and from medical aid, with what
it was, when he represented his native state of New Hampshire
in congress, or during his travels in Europe. Such
are some of the hardships and inconveniences attending the
first settlers in a new country.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>After approving what doctor Merrit had prescribed, and
recommending a continuance of his regimen and advice,
which consisted of alterative catharticks followed by tonicks,
we took our leave, impressed with the opinion that Mr.
Hunt had but a few hours longer of existence, which also
seemed to be his own opinion, as when I addressed a few
cheering words to him, he only answered by shaking his
head and closing his eyes. I supposed the rest of the family
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>would recover. White is an intelligent man, and makes
a trade of sinking wells, of which he has sunk a very fine
one, of forty-five feet deep for Mr. Hunt, near a good two
story house almost finished.</p>

<p>French Grant contains twenty-four thousand acres, given
by the United States to some French settlers, who had been
disappointed in the titles of their purchases at Galliopolis,
amongst whom a Mons. Gervais<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> had for his part four
thousand acres, on which he planned a town, which he
named Burrsburgh, in honour of the then vice president:
but after passing ten solitary years in a small log cabin, with
no society except that of his dog and cat, during which time
he employed himself in cultivating his little garden, he last
year sold his whole tract to Mr. Hunt, except two hundred
and seventeen acres, given by him to an {139} agent in
Philadelphia, as a recompence for his having enabled him
to fulfil the engagement to government by which he held
the land. He now lives in Galliopolis, and Mr. Hunt has
changed the intended Burrsburgh into a farm.</p>

<p>On our walk to the boat I gave White some directions for
himself as preventive to the prevailing disorder, for which he
thanked me, and asked our charge for the freight of doctor
Merrit’s box in such a manner as to preclude the possibility
of making any.</p>

<p>We then crossed the river at Greenupsburgh, the seat
of justice of Greenup county, in Kentucky. It is laid out
for a town within the last year, but it contains as yet only
one dwelling house, occupied by one Lyons as a tavern,
where the courts are held; immediately in the rear of which
is a strong and wretched dungeon of double logs, called the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>gaol, with a pillory between. Little Sandy river, about
seventy yards wide, flows into the Ohio just below Greenupsburgh.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when we landed at Lyons’s. We
ordered supper, during the preparation of which Mrs. Lyons
requested my advice for her husband, who had been seized
that morning by the prevailing fever. I wrote a prescription
for him <i>secundum artem</i>, which I thought fully equivalent
to our supper, but as she gave us no credit for it in our
bill, she probably supposed that a travelling doctor ought
to prescribe gratis.</p>

<p>We had an excellent supper of tea, nice broiled chickens,
and fine biscuit, to which travelling and rowing gave us good
appetite, notwithstanding we saw our landlady take the
table cloth from under her sick husband’s bed clothes.
After this let not the delicate town bred man affect disgust
at the calls of nature being satisfied in a manner he is unused
to, as {140} in a similar situation, I will venture to assert, he
would do as we did.</p>

<p>After supper, we dropped down the stream about a mile,
then anchored with a stone at the end of a rope, at a little
distance from the shore, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Proceeding, on the twenty-eighth, at the dawn of day,
by half past five we were abreast of Green township, a small
hamlet of six or seven houses, on the right, in French Grant,
three miles below Greenupsburgh. Six miles lower, we
left on the right, Little Sciota river, about thirty yards wide.</p>

<p>Half a mile further, on the same side, we passed a stratum
of iron ore, and a mile below that, a stony point projecting
and sloping downwards, forming a fine harbour for boats,
when the point is not overflowed. Tiger creek, about
twenty yards wide, and apparently navigable for boats,
flows in from the Kentucky side, three miles lower down,
opposite to which, from Little Sciota river, the bottoms are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>very narrow, being confined by a picturesque range of low
rocky cliffs and mountains, with a few straggling pines overtopping
the other trees on their summits.</p>

<p>Three miles further we stopped at Portsmouth on the
right, and breakfasted at John Brown’s tavern. Mr. Brown
is a magistrate and keeps a store. After breakfast, the wind
blowing too fresh up the river for us to make any progress
without great labour, I walked to the upper end of the town,
through a straight street, parallel to the Ohio, about half
a mile long, on the top of a handsome sloping bank. I returned
by a back street, which brought me to the banks of
the Scioto, which river, running from the northward, falls
into the Ohio a mile below Portsmouth, at an angle of
thirty-three degrees, leaving only sufficient room between
the two rivers for two parallel streets, on the one of which
fronting the Ohio, building lots of a quarter of an acre, now
sell at fifty dollars each. There is a {141} narrow level
near a mile long below the town to the point of junction of
the Scioto with the Ohio, which cannot be built on, as it is
annually inundated by the spring floods: there is now a
fine field of corn on it, and it would all make excellent
meadow. Mr. Massie, of Chilicothe, who is proprietor of
both it and the town, asks fifteen hundred dollars for it,
though it does not appear to contain fifty acres.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Portsmouth is in a handsome and healthy situation,
though rather too much confined by the Scioto’s approach
to the Ohio, so far above its confluence with that river. It
is likely to become a town of some consequence, as it is the
capital of the county of Scioto. It is only two years since
it was laid out, and it now contains twenty houses, some of
which are of brick, and most of them very good. I was
shewn the scite of a court-house intended to be erected immediately.</p>

<p>Alexandria, in sight, below the mouth of the Scioto, is
on a high, commanding bank, and makes a handsome appearance
from above Portsmouth, to travellers descending
the river. It is eleven years old, but it has not thriven, and
the erection of the town of Portsmouth so near it, has caused
it to decline rapidly. It has still however the post-office for
both towns.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable naked, round topped, rocky mountain,
on the Virginia side, opposite to Portsmouth, which
forms a variety to the forest covered hills, which every where
meet the eye of the traveller through this western region.</p>

<p>We observed here, vast numbers of beautiful large, green
paroquets, which our landlord, squire Brown, informed us
abound all over the country. They keep in flocks, and
when they alight on a tree, they are not distinguishable from
the foliage, from their colour.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

a colony to the Ohio, where he had negotiated a purchase in the French Grant from
the owner, Gervais. He engaged as a housekeeper, Miss Cynthia Riggs; and came
out on horseback in the fall of 1806. Cuming’s fears were realized, for Hunt
died a few days after he had passed. The New Hampshire colony emigrated

a large tract between the Scioto and Miami rivers for bounty lands for her soldiers.
Massie began the survey thereof in 1788, and two years later led out the first colony
on the site of Manchester, Ohio. At the close of the Indian wars Chillicothe was
platted (1796), and became the first capital of the state of Ohio. Massie was an
influential leader in early Ohio politics; he headed the opposition to General St.

politics, his presence at the constitutional convention aided in giving a democratic
cast to the new state constitution. For many years he acted as major-general

<p>The Scioto is about two hundred and fifty yards wide at
its mouth, and is navigable for large flats and keel boats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>to Chilicothe, the capital of the state, forty-seven miles by
land, but between sixty and seventy following the meanders
of the river; and about a hundred miles further for batteaux,
from whence is a portage of only four miles to Sandusky
river which falls into Lake Erie—and near the banks of
which the Five Nations have established their principal
settlements, called the Sandusky towns. Its general course
is about S. S. W. and except during the spring floods, it has
a gentle current, and an easy navigation. About thirty
miles from its mouth, and eight or ten from its left bank,
are some salt springs, which make salt enough for the consumption
of the country for forty or fifty miles round.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>At three o’clock we left Portsmouth, from whence to
Alexandria is W. S. W. about a mile and a quarter. We
landed there and walked through the town, which contains
only ten large houses besides barns and other out buildings—but,
though inhabited, they are neglected and out of
repair, and every thing bears the appearance of poverty
and decay. From hence to Chilicothe the distance by the
road is forty-seven miles.</p>

<p>We delayed about an hour, and then proceeding down
the river, we observed the hills on the left to be of conical
forms, and the river bottoms very narrow. About four
miles below Alexandria we observed rather a tasty cottage
and improvement on the right. We inquired of a gentlemanly
looking elderly man on the bank, “who resided
there?” but {143} he uncourteously not deigning a reply,
we were informed at the next settlement that it was a Major
Bellisle.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Passing Turkey creek on the right, and Conoconecq
creek on the left, seven miles more brought us opposite to a
very handsome insulated mountain, five hundred feet high,
on the right, and passing Willow (small) island and bar on
the same hand, we landed nearly opposite to buy milk at a
decent looking cabin and small farm. It was owned by one
Colgin, an Irishman, who has been several years in Kentucky,
but only two in his present residence. He has only
eight acres cleared, on which he maintains himself, his wife,
and seven children, who are all comfortably and even becomingly
drest. There was an air of natural civility, and
even kindness, in the manner of this family, which I had not
observed before on the banks of the Ohio. The children,
who were all born in Kentucky, were uncommonly handsome.</p>

<p>Three miles further we passed on the right, Twin creeks,
about a hundred yards apart, a mile beyond which we anchored
under the Ohio shore at half past nine, and passed
under our awning as cold a night as I have experienced in
the more northern climates in November. The sudden
and frequent changes from excessive heat to excessive cold
throughout the United States, are amongst the greatest inconveniences
to which the inhabitants are exposed, and are
very trying to delicate constitutions, being the cause of
pulmonary complaints, which are very common, particularly
among the females.</p>

<p>On the clear, cold morning, of the twenty-ninth of July,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>we hauled up our anchor, and dropping down the current
three miles, we landed at Salt Lick landing, at six o’clock.</p>

<p>We walked about a mile to the salt springs. The old
original one, formerly used by the Indians, and another
lately opened, are on the west side of Salt Lick {144} creek
and are owned by a family of the name of Beal. Three
others on the east side of the creek, opened within three
years, belong to a Mr. Greenup. The salt is made in three
furnaces at Beal’s springs, and in four at Greenup’s. Each
furnace contains fifty cast iron pans, of about twenty gallons
each, and makes, on Greenup’s side, one hundred bushels
of salt per week, while on Beal’s side they make only sixty
bushels per week, in each furnace. The price of salt at
the works is two dollars per bushel. A furnace requires
eight men to do its work, whose wages are from twenty to
twenty-five dollars per month each. The water in the old
spring is near the surface, but the new wells are sunk to the
depth of fifty-five feet. The water is wound up by hand by
a windlass, in buckets, and emptied into wooden troughs,
which lead to the furnaces. The old spring has two pumps
in it. Much labour might be saved by machinery wrought
either by horses, or by the water of the neighbouring creek;
but in so new a country one must not expect to find the
arts in perfection.</p>

<p>The proprietors of each furnace pay a yearly rent of from
three to five hundred bushels of salt to the proprietors of
the soil.</p>

<p>The valley in which the springs are is small, and surrounded
by broken and rather barren hills, but producing
wood enough to supply the furnaces with fuel constantly,
if properly managed.</p>

<p>There is a wagon road of seventy miles from hence to
Lexington, through a country settled the whole way. The
road passes the upper Blue Licks, where are also salt springs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>and furnaces, not nearly however so productive as these.
The Salt Lick springs, which are the strongest in this western
country, are not half so strongly impregnated with salt,
as the water of the ocean, yielding only about one pound of
salt, from sixty pounds of water.</p>

<p>{145} What a subject of admiration does it not afford to
the moralizing philosopher, that such a provision should be
made by all bountiful nature, or rather by nature’s God, for
supplying both the intellectual and brute creation, with an
article so necessary to both, in the heart of an immense
continent, so remote from any ocean.</p>

<p>There are three or four houses at the landing, which
was intended as the scite of the county town, but the seat
of the courts has been established four miles lower down
the Ohio.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>We breakfasted on good coffee, biscuit, meat and cheese,
at the house of one M’Bride, an Irishman, who has a fine
family of ten children all living.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock we proceeded to drop down the river.
The hills on each side still continued broken, separate, and
pointed, and the bottoms narrow. The appearance of the
timber since we passed Little Sandy, indicated the soil to be
not so rich as above that river, it being of a much smaller
growth.</p>

<p>About eight miles from Salt Lick we passed on the left
a fine settlement of several large farms and good farm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>houses, called Graham’s station on Kennedy’s bottom, and
three miles further on the right the new town of Adamsville,
with one very good house and three or four small ones,
finely situated at {146} the mouth of Brush creek, which is a
charming little river about thirty-five yards wide.</p>

<p>From hence we observed several good farm houses in
fine situations, on the left, and an extensive bottom, well
settled, on the right, the Ohio being about half a mile wide
between.</p>

<p>At Sycamore creek, which is very small, on the left, two
miles below Brush creek, is a good house, finely situated,
with a ferry for the Ohio. Here we spoke a man of the
name of May, who with his wife and child, and an aged
mother, had been seven weeks descending the Mississippi
and ascending the Ohio in a skiff; bound from St. Louis in
upper Louisiana, to Pittsburgh, a distance of thirteen hundred
miles, on a visit to two of his brothers residing there.
They had just landed to cook their dinner. I mention this
merely to give some idea how little the inhabitants of this
country think of journies which would seem impracticable
to the stationary residents of Europe.</p>

<p>Since passing Brush creek, I observed the river hills to be
lower, their tops flatter, and the country less broken: the
river too had widened to the breadth of three quarters of a
mile, and Pennaway’s handsome brick house on a fine farm,
separated by Donaldson’s creek from the widow Smith’s
farm house, the latter decorated with a balcony and piazza,
and beautifully situated, with the wooded hills rising gradually
behind, formed altogether imagery worthy a good landscape
painter. From hence there is also a charming view
down the river, through a vista formed by Massey’s island
and the high right bank on which the town of Manchester
is placed.</p>

<p>Four miles and a half below Sycamore creek, instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>going through the vista which was open to the eye, we kept
over to the left shore in the main channel, to the left of a
small island, which is joined at low water by a semicircular
sand bar to Massey’s {147} island, a fine harbour being
formed by the bar between the islands except in inundations
of the river.</p>

<p>Massey’s island is about two miles long, but it is very narrow.
It belongs to two owners, it is very fertile and partly
cultivated.</p>

<p>At four o’clock we passed the lower end of Massey’s
island, rowed over to the right shore, and landed at Manchester,
a quarter of a mile lower down.</p>

<p>This town has been settled twelve years, but contains
only ten dwelling houses, most delightfully situated on a
high plain, commanding charming prospects of the river
both above and below. It is a post town, and is only three
miles distant from the great state road through the state
of Ohio to Lexington in Kentucky; but it is a poor place,
and not likely to improve, as its vicinity to Maysville, which
is only twelve miles lower where the road crosses the river,
prevents its being frequented by travellers.</p>

<p>We delayed but a few minutes at Manchester, and then
proceeding, we passed Isaac creek with a wooden bridge
over it, on the right, a mile below. A mile lower we saw
on the left a very handsome farm house, an orchard and a
fine farm; opposite to which on the right, the river hills
approach close to the bank.</p>

<p>Two miles further we passed Crooked creek on the left,
the hills now approaching on that side, and receding on the
right, leaving a fine extensive bottom between them and the
river.</p>

<p>Cabin creek on the left is a mile and a half below Crooked
creek, and has a good farm and handsome farm house at its
mouth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>
<p>Three miles lower, on the left, is William Brookes’s creek,
below which is a floating mill, and Brookes’s good house and
fine farm on a very pleasant point, where a bottom commences,
which extends to Limestone, while the same ridge
of hills which we passed below Isaac creek, after semicircularly
{148} bounding a deep, long and well settled bottom,
again approach the right bank of the Ohio opposite
Brookes’s.</p>

<p>It may be proper to remark here, that in general, when
the river hills approach the river on one side, they recede
on the other, so that hills on one side are opposite to bottoms
on the other.</p>

<p>From just below Brookes’s, we had a fine view down a
reach, about three miles, with Limestone or Maysville in
sight at the end of it, and passing the straggling but pleasant
village of Madison on the left, Limestone creek, and two
gun boats at anchor, we landed there a little before eight
o’clock.</p>

<p>We got a good supper and beds at Mr. S. January’s, who
keeps an excellent house, and is a polite, well informed and
attentive landlord.</p>

<p>Next morning Thursday the 30th July, we walked, accompanied
by our host to the scite of a formerly intended
glass house, on the bank about three quarters of a mile
above the town; which failed of being erected in consequence
of the glass blowers who were engaged not having arrived
to perform their contract.</p>

<p>During our walk, we were shewn the scites of no less than
three projected towns, on the different properties of Messrs.
Martin, Brookes, and Coburn, at any of which, the situations
were better than at Maysville, both in point of room
for building, and communication with the interior of the
country. They however all failed, in favour of Maysville;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>but those attempts to establish towns on their estates,
will serve to give some idea of the ambitious and enterprising
spirit which actuates the landholders in this country.</p>

<p>Maysville is the greatest shipping port on the Ohio,
below Pittsburgh, but it is merely such, not being a place
of much business itself, but only serving as the principal
port for the north eastern part of the state {149} of Kentucky,
as Louisville does for the south western. It has not increased
any for several years, and contains only about sixty houses.
It is closely hemmed in by the river hills, over which the most
direct road from Philadelphia through Pittsburgh and Chilicothe
leads to Lexington, and thence through the state of
Tennessee to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Several vessels of all sizes from four hundred tons downwards,
have been built here, but as none are now going forward,
I presume the builders did not find that business
answerable to their expectations. It is a post town, the mails
from both east and west arriving on Wednesdays and
Saturdays. Its situation causing it to be much resorted by
travellers, that gives it an appearance of liveliness and
bustle, which might induce a stranger to think it a place of
more consequence in itself than it really is.</p>

<p>After breakfasting with our host, I delivered a letter of
introduction to Mr. George Gallagher, one of the principal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>merchants, who received me very politely; then leaving our
boat with our landlord to be disposed of, we set out on foot
for Lexington, at half past eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>Our road led over a high hill but of easy ascent for about
half a mile, with small cultivated spots here and there.
When at the summit of the river hills, we entered on a fine
country, consisting of hill {150} and dale, with very extensive
farms, and some of the largest fields of Indian corn I
had ever seen. Perhaps no plantation has a more beautiful
appearance than a field of maize in that stage of vegetation
in which we now saw it. It was in tassel and silk according
to the country terms. The first of these is the flower or
blossom, which grows on the top of the plant which is from
eight to twelve feet high. It is of a light brown colour and
resembles the feather of a quill stripped down and twisted
round the stem, and nods and trembles with the slightest air
of wind. The latter consists of a few silky and silvery
threads, which issue from the end of each ear, from two to
three of which grow at the height of about two thirds of the
stalk. The leaves which grow luxuriantly from the stalk
to from a foot to two feet long, are of a deep and rich green,
and have their ends generally bent down by their own
weight. It is impossible to convey an idea on paper of the
beauty of a field of fifty or sixty acres in this state. A
field of sugar canes in the West Indies, when nearly ripe,
comes the nearest to it in beauty and appearance of any
other species of cultivation I am acquainted with. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>might be deemed impertinent to occupy the time of the
American reader, in describing the appearance of a field, to
the sight of which he is so accustomed, but should these
sheets ever find their way to Europe, it may afford information
to those who may never have an opportunity of knowing
more of the culture of so useful, so noble and so beautiful
a plant.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>{151} About half a mile further, we passed on the right
the handsome house, spacious square barn, fine farm and
improvements of major John Brown, an Irishman, the
whole together indicating taste and opulence.</p>

<p>A mile and a half beyond this on the left, is a large and
remarkably well built brick house of a Mr. Blanchard, well
situated, but left rather naked of wood.</p>

<p>The country on every side appears to be better improved
than I have observed it in any part of America, and wonderfully
abundant in grain, chiefly Indian corn.</p>

<p>Four miles from Maysville, we entered the flourishing
town of Washington, which is laid out on a roomy and
liberal plan, in three parallel streets, containing only as
yet ninety-six houses, mostly large and good ones. There
is here a good stone court-house with a small belfry, a
church of brick for a society of Scotch Presbyterians, and
another of wood for one of Anabaptists. Washington being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>the capital of Braken county, and in the heart of a very
rich country, is a thriving town, and will probably continue
to be so, notwithstanding it is without the advantage of
any navigable river nearer than the Ohio at Maysville.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lee a merchant here, to whom I had letters of introduction
was polite and obliging.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> We got an excellent
dinner, at Ebert’s tavern; after which we hired two horses
through Mr. Lee’s interest, as it is difficult for strangers to
procure horses on hire throughout this country. We engaged
one at half a dollar, and the other at three quarters of a dollar
a {152} day; the last from a Mr. Fristoe, a small man of
sixty-eight, married to his second wife of thirty-two years
of age. She is a contrast to her husband in size as well as
years, she being tall and fat, and weighing two hundred and
forty pounds. She is two years younger than his youngest
daughter by his first wife. He has grand and great grandchildren
born in Kentucky. He is a Virginian, and was
once a man of large property, when he resided on the banks
of one of the rivers which fall into the Chesapeak, where he
loaded the ship in which captain, afterwards consul O’Brien
was captured by the Algerines. By unfortunate land jobbing
in Kentucky, he has lost his property, and is now a
butcher in Washington.</p>

<p>He is truly a philosopher, contrasting his former with his
present situation, with much good humour and pleasantry.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, we left Washington on horseback, and
travelled on a good road through a well improved country,
four miles to the north fork of Licking river, which we crossed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>by a wooden bridge supported by four piers of hammered
limestone, with a transverse sleeper of timber on each which
supports the sill. The bridge is seventy-seven yards long,
and only wants abutments to be very complete. A wagonner
had stopped his wagon on it to measure its proportions.
He told me that he had contracted to build a similar
bridge over the south fork of Licking at Cynthiana, forty
miles from hence, which is larger than the north fork. It
may seem strange that a wagonner should be employed as a
builder, but it is common throughout the United States, particularly
at a distance from the sea coast, for one man to
have learned and wrought at two, and even sometimes three
or four different mechanical professions, at different periods
of his life.</p>

<p>{153} The country still continued fine, but not quite so
well improved, to Lee’s creek mill, three miles and a half
beyond the north fork of Licking. The mill was now
stopped for want of water in the creek, which is an inconvenience
to which the whole of the western country is liable,
the brooks and small rivers generally failing during the
summer.</p>

<p>Half a mile further we came to a small post town, called
May’s-lick, containing only eight or ten houses, irregularly
scattered on the side of a hill. We here stopped to feed
our horses, and then proceeded four miles through a good
natural, but indifferently improved country to Clark’s excellent
mill on Johnston’s fork of Licking, which is a fine
mill stream, and falls into Licking river, several miles lower
down. The road on each side the fork is very bad, the hills
being extremely steep.</p>

<p>After passing Clark’s mill, we found the country gradually
worse cultivated, less inhabited, and at last a continuation
of barren hills, bearing very little besides wild pennyroyal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>with which the air is strongly perfumed, and a few stunted
shrubs and trees, there being nothing to promote vegetation,
but gravel and loose stones of every variety—marble,
limestone, flint, freestone, and granate, among which the
limestone is the most predominant. The road also was
very bad for the three or four miles next to the Blue salt
licks on Licking river, which is eight miles from Clark’s
mill.</p>

<p>On the road we met a Mr. Ball and another man, both
armed, going in search of four negro slaves, who had ran
away from him, and two of his neighbours near Boonsborough,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
seven had ran away, but three had been apprehended
that morning.</p>

<p>We saw from the eminences on the road, the smoke of
the salt furnaces, when three miles distant from them.</p>

<p>{154} In fording the Licking, which is a fine river about
eighty yards wide, we kept rather too high, and got into such
deep water that mine had to swim some yards, while A——,
who was behind me took advantage of my mistake, and
kept lower down, so that his horse was only up to the
saddle skirts.</p>

<p>Some negro salt labourers on the bank, mischievously
beckoned and called to us towards them, enjoying our embarrassment,
but taking care to get out of sight when we
got firm footing on the same side of the river with them.</p>

<p>We found Mrs. Williams an obliging hostess, and her
sister Miss Howard, a very agreeable woman; they favoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>us with their company at supper, and were both much better
bred, and better informed than most of the tavern ladies
we had seen since we left Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>There were some other ladies and some children in the
house from Washington, who were here for the benefit of
drinking the waters of the salt spring, which are esteemed
efficacious in some disorders. They are frequented by
people from different parts of the state, as both a cure and
antidote for every disorder incident to the human frame.
I believe them to be perfectly neutral: They are impregnated
with sulphur, and smell and taste exactly like the bilge
water in a ship’s hold, of course they are very nauseous.
They act sometimes as a cathartick, and sometimes as an
emetick, but without causing either griping, or sickness of
the stomach.</p>

<p>There are seven furnaces wrought here, but the water
which lies at the surface is not near so strong as that at the
salt lick near the Ohio, each furnace here making only about
twenty-five bushels of salt per week. The Blue lick salt
is much whiter and handsomer than the other, but it only
sells at the same price. Each furnace rents at about three
hundred dollars a year.</p>

<p>{155} These licks were much frequented by buffaloes and
deer, the former of which have been destroyed or terrified
from the country. It is only fourteen or fifteen years since
no other except buffaloe or bear meat was used by the inhabitants
of this country.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

by the pioneer for whom it was named. It was the capital of the Transylvania
Company, and the scene of some of the most noted events of early Kentucky history,
particularly during the siege of 1778. Boonesborough declined in importance
after the Indian wars; in 1810 it was a mere hamlet, and since that but the site of a
farm. For further details see the excellent monograph of Ranck, <i>Boonesborough</i>

Kentucky annals, and Daniel Boone was here engaged in making salt when captured

battle fought here, August 19, 1782, in which the flower of Kentucky frontiersmen
lost their lives. See Young, “Battle of Blue Licks” in Durrett, <i>Bryant’s Station</i>

<p>Friday, twenty-first July, we arose early and proceeded
on our journey. At about two miles from Blue Licks we
passed a tavern, a double log gaol and a court-house in a
very solitary situation, dignified with the name of Nicholasville,
it being the seat of the county courts of Nicholas
county. In one spot on the road were two crows, two doves,
four red birds, and four partridges, assembled as if in council.
They all took wing at our approach except the partridges,
which in this country are wonderfully abundant,
and very tame. They will walk quietly to the side of the
road and look at the passing traveller with innocent confidence.</p>

<p>There were but one or two houses in the next six miles,
which are through a stony defile between barren hills. The
country then becomes better inhabited and the soil gradually
improves to Millersburgh, a village of about thirty
houses, thirteen miles from Blue Licks.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> There is on the
road an old shaft where an attempt was made to come at a
salt spring {156} without success, but a little further they
succeeded in finding a very strong one, which was rendered
useless by some springs of fresh water flowing into the salt,
at such a depth as to render the turning them away if not
impracticable, at least too expensive.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at Capt. Waller’s tavern, at Millersburgh.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>Our host was an obliging and sensible man, and
possessed of good general information relative to this country:
he was not destitute of some particular also. We collected
from him, that when he first arrived in Kentucky,
about twenty-three years ago, there was not a house between
Limestone and Lexington, and at the latter place were only
a few log cabins under the protection of a stoccado fort.—That
there was not half a mile of the road between the two
places unstained by human blood.—That in 1782, on the
heights above the Blue Lick, 2000 Indians drew 1500
Americans into an ambush, by partially exposing themselves,
and so tempting the latter to attack them. The American
commander, Col. Todd, and six hundred of his men were
killed, and the whole party would have been destroyed had
the remainder not saved themselves by throwing themselves
into the Licking and gaining the opposite bank, to which
the Indians did not chuse to pursue them, satisfied with the
slaughter they had made.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> He said that buffaloes, bears
and deer were so plenty in the country, even long after it
began to be generally settled, and ceased to be frequented
as a hunting ground by the Indians, that little or no bread
was used, but that even the children were fed on game; the
facility of gaining which prevented the progress of agriculture,
until the poor innocent buffaloes were completely
extirpated, and the other wild animals much thinned: And
that the principal part of the cultivation of Kentucky had
been within the last fifteen years. He said the buffaloes
had been so numerous, going in herds of several hundreds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>together, that {157} about the salt licks and springs they frequented,
they pressed down and destroyed the soil to a
depth of three or four feet, as was conspicuous yet in the
neighbourhood of the Blue Lick, where all the old trees
have their roots bare of soil to that depth.—Those harmless
and unsuspecting animals, used to stand gazing with apparent
curiosity at their destroyer, until he was sometimes
within twenty yards of them, when he made it a rule to select
the leader, which was always an old and fat female. When
she was killed, which rarely failed from the great dexterity
of the hunter, the rest of the herd would not desert her, until
he had shot as many as he thought proper. If one of the
common herd was the first victim of the rifle, the rest would
immediately fly. The males sometimes exceeded a thousand
pounds weight, but the females were seldom heavier
than five hundred. He said that the whole country was
then an entire cane brake, which sometimes grew to forty
feet high, but that the domestick stock introduced by the
settlers have eradicated the cane, except in some remote
and unsettled parts of the state. He described that plant,
as springing up with a tender shoot, like asparagus, which
cattle are very fond of.</p>

<p>Millerstown has been settled about ten years, but it is not
thriving, though it seems well calculated for a manufacturing
town, from its situation on the bank of Hinckson’s fork of
the Licking, which is a good mill stream, and over which
there is a wooden bridge.</p>

<p>Several strata of lead ore, parallel to the surface, and
from three inches to a foot in thickness, have been discovered
in the town, and neighbourhood; and about a year ago,
a Mr. Elliot, erected a furnace and made sixteen tons of
pure lead, but for want of funds to prosecute the business
to effect, he was obliged to cease exertions, which, with
proper encouragement, might have been a source of very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>extensive traffick to {158} this state, independent of the
keeping in it a considerable sum of the circulating medium
which is now paid for that useful metal, with which it is
supplied from St. Genevieve in Upper Louisiana, at a profit
of one hundred per cent.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>From Millersburgh we travelled about seven miles, over
a fine soil, but not much improved on account of the uncertainty
of titles. We then turned out of the main road into
a path through the woods, which we were informed would
shorten our road two miles to Baylor’s mills, where Mr. A—— had
business, but after losing ourselves in a labyrinth of
cross paths, and riding five miles instead of two, we at last
found ourselves at Col. Garret’s fine stone house and extensive
farm,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> where a young lady from an upper window,
gave us directions, by the aid of which we soon found Mr.
Baylor’s.</p>

<p>We had to regret the absence from home of young Mr. and
Mrs. Baylor,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> as Mr. A. was personally acquainted with
them, and we had promised ourselves a musical feast, from
the performance of Mrs. B. on the piano forte, on which
instrument she is said particularly to excel. They not being
at home, we declined the invitation of a younger Mr. B. to
alight, but taking a glass of milk and water on horseback,
we proceeded across Stoner’s fork of the Licking, towards
Lexington, leaving the town of Paris about three miles on
the left.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Our ride now was on a charming road finely shaded by
woods, with now and then a good farm, five miles to Johnston’s
tavern, where we fed our horses and got some refreshment.
Capt. Johnston is most comfortably settled on a
fine farm, having a son married and settled on an equally
good one, on one side, and a daughter equally well situated
on the other. He and his wife are good looking, middle
aged people, {159} and both in their persons, and in every
thing around them, have the appearance of being possessed
of the happy <i>otium</i> of life. He had a quantity of last year’s
produce in his granaries, and his wheat, his corn and tobacco
fields, with a large tract of meadow, were smiling in luxuriant
abundance around him.</p>

<p>The country continued fine, and more cultivated for
the next six miles, hill and dale alternately, but the hills only
gentle slopes: we then ascending a chain of rather higher
hills than we had lately crossed, called Ash ridge, we passed
a small meeting-house on the right, and Mr. Robert Carter
Harrison’s large house, fine farm and improvements on
the left, separated by the north branch of Elkhorn river
from Jamison’s mill. We then crossed that river, and soon
after, on a fine elevated situation, we passed general Russel’s
house on the right, with a small lawn in front of it, and two
small turrets at the corners of the lawn next the road.
The <i>tout ensemble</i> wanting only the vineyards to resemble
many of the country habitations of Languedoc and Provence.
I have little doubt, but at some future period, that
feature will also be added to it, as in this climate and soil
grapes would grow most luxuriantly; when therefore the
population of this country becomes adequate to the culture
of the vine, it will assuredly not be neglected.</p>

<p>Overtaking a gentleman on horseback, who had been
overseeing some mowers in a meadow, he joined company
with, and civilly entered into conversation with us. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>general Russel who had been riding round his farm. We
discussed various topicks respecting the natural and improved
state of the country, and the present state of political
affairs. He had just returned from Richmond in Virginia,
where he had been during the examination of Col. Burr,
before the grand jury. He evinced much good sense, intelligence,
candour and liberality in his opinions, {160} not
only with regard to that extraordinary man, who has caused
such a ferment throughout the union, but on the various
other subjects which we conversed on. He obligingly
accompanied us about five miles, as an afternoon’s ride, and
at parting, he gave us a friendly and polite invitation to visit
him at his cottage, on our return.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>He described the well where he has his spring house, as a
great natural curiosity; there being a grotto under it which
terminates in a cavern in the limestone rock, which has been
explored nearly a hundred yards without finding the termination.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> General William Russell was a Virginian by birth, who had lived in the
southwestern part of that state, and from boyhood had been accustomed to Indian
warfare. He participated in the battles of King’s Mountain and Guilford Court
House, and in the expedition against the Cherokees. After emigrating to Kentucky,
he served with Scott, Wilkinson, and Wayne in their Indian campaigns,
showing great military capacity. Again in 1811, and in the Western battles of
the War of 1812-15, the services of General Russell were of much importance. In
politics he was as prominent as in warfare, representing his county (Fayette) in
the Kentucky legislature for thirteen terms, but finally suffering defeat as a candidate
for governor (1824). The following year he died on his farm, where Cuming
had met him.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The country had insensibly assumed the appearance of an
approach to a city.—The roads very wide and fine, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>grazing parks, meadows, and every spot in sight cultivated.</p>

<p>Soon after parting with the general, we were gratified
with a view of Lexington, about half a mile distant, from an
eminence on the road. On entering the town we were struck
with the fine roomy scale on which every thing appeared to
be planned. Spacious streets, and large houses chiefly
of brick, which since the year 1795, have been rapidly taking
the place of the original wooden ones, several of which however
yet remain.</p>

<p>We turned up the main street, which is about eighty feet
wide, compactly built, well paved, and {161} having a footway,
twelve feet wide on each side.—Passing several very
handsome brick houses of two and three stories, numerous
stores well filled with merchandize of every description, and
the market place and court-house, we dismounted at Wilson’s
inn, and entered the traveller’s room, which had several
strangers in it. Shortly after, the supper bell ringing, we
obeyed the summons, and were ushered into a room about
forty feet long, where, at the head of a table, laid out with
neatness, plenty and variety, sat our well dressed hostess,
who did the honours of it with much ease and propriety.</p>

<p>We retired early, and next morning, before breakfast,
went to the market, which is held every Wednesday and
Saturday. We were surprised at the number of horses
belonging to the neighbouring farmers, which were fastened
around on the outside, and on entering the market place we
were equally astonished at the profusion and variety of most
of the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life. There
was not however such a display of flesh meat as is seen in
Pittsburgh, which might be owing to the warmth of the
climate at that season. Prices were nearly similar to those
at Pittsburgh: beef four cents per pound, bacon eight, butter
twelve and a half; lamb twenty-five cents a quarter, corn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>meal forty-two cents per bushel, and every thing else in proportion.
Vegetables were in great abundance and very
cheap, and were sold mostly by negro men and women;
indeed that race were the most predominant both as to
sellers and buyers.</p>

<p>Our beds had been very good, and our breakfast and
dinner to-day, were correspondent to our supper last night—displaying
a variety neatly and handsomely served up,
with excellent attendance.</p>

<p>I employed the forenoon in running over and viewing
the town. It contains three hundred and sixty-six dwelling
houses, besides barns, stables and {162} other out offices.
The streets cross each other at right angles, and are from
fifty to eighty feet wide. A rivulet which turns some mills
below the town, runs through the middle of Water street,
but it is covered by an arch, and levelled over it the length
of the street. It falls into the Elkhorn a few miles to the
N. W.</p>

<p>There are societies of Presbyterians, Seceders, Episcopalians,
Anabaptists and Roman Catholicks, each of which
has a church, no way remarkable, except the Episcopalian,
which is very neat and convenient. There is also a society
of Methodists, which has not yet any regular house of worship.
The court-house now finishing, is a good, plain,
brick building, of three stories, with a cupola, rising from
the middle of the square roof, containing a bell and a town
clock. The cupola is supported by four large brick columns
in the centre of the house, rising from the foundation,
through the hall of justice, and in my opinion adding nothing
to its beauty or convenience. The whole building when finished,
will cost about fifteen thousand dollars. The masonick
hall, is a neat brick building, as is also the bank, where
going for change for a Philadelphia bank note, I received in
specie one per cent. advance, which they allow on the notes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>of the Atlantick cities for the convenience of remitting.
There is a publick library and a university, called Transylvania,
which is incorporated and is under the government
of twenty-one trustees and the direction of a president, the
Rev. James Blythe, who is also professor of natural philosophy,
mathematicks, geography and English grammar.
There are four professors besides: the Rev. Robert H.
Bishop, professor of moral philosophy, belles lettres, logick
and history; Mr. Ebenezer Sharpe, professor of the languages;
Doctor James Fishback, professor of medicine,
&amp;c. and Henry Clay, Esq. professor of law. The funds of
the university arise from the price of tuition, (which {163}
is lower than in any other seminary of learning in the United
States) and from eight thousand acres of first rate land,
granted to it by the state of Virginia; five thousand of which
are in the neighbourhood of Lexington, and three thousand
near Louisville at the falls of Ohio. The legislature of
Kentucky have also granted to it six thousand acres of
valuable land, south of Green river. Its yearly income
from the lands, now amounts to about two thousand dollars,
which will probably be soon much increased.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>There are no fewer than three creditable boarding schools
for female education, in which there are at present above
a hundred pupils. An extract from Mrs. Beck’s card, will
convey some idea of the progress of polite education in this
country.</p>

<p>“Boarders instructed in the following branches, at the
rate of two hundred dollars per annum, viz. Reading, spelling,
writing, arithmetick, grammar, epistolary correspondence,
elocution and rhetorick; geography, with the use of maps,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>globes, and the armillary sphere; astronomy, with the advantage
of an orrery; ancient and modern history; chronology,
mythology, and natural history; natural and moral philosophy;
musick, vocal and instrumental; drawing, painting, and
embroidery of all kinds; artificial flowers, and any other
fashionable fancy-work; plain sewing, marking, netting,
&amp;c.”</p>

<p>The card designates a regular course of education, as it
proceeds through the successional branches, all of which
cannot be studied by any individual at the same time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beck is an English lady, and is in high reputation
as an instructress. She was now absent, having taken
advantage of a vacation, to visit the Olympian Springs,
about fifty miles from Lexington, much resorted, on account
of their salubrious effects.</p>

<p>There is no regular academy for males, but there are
several day schools.</p>

<p>{164} The number of inhabitants in Lexington, in 1806,
was 1655 free white inhabitants, and 1165 negro slaves, in
all 2820. The whole number may now be safely estimated
at 3000.</p>

<p>There are three nail manufacturies, which make about
sixty tons of nails per annum; and there are ten blacksmith’s
shops, which find constant employment for a considerable
number of hands.</p>

<p>There are two copper and tin manufacturies, one of which
manufactures ware to the amount of ten thousand dollars
yearly; the other is on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>There are four jewellers and silversmiths, whose business
is very profitable.</p>

<p>Seven saddler’s shops employ thirty hands, the proceeds
of whose labour is annually from twenty-five to thirty
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>There are four cabinet-maker’s shops, where household
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>furniture is manufactured in as handsome a style as in any
part of America, and where the high finish which is given
to the native walnut and cherry timber, precludes the
regret that mahogany is not to be had but at an immense
expense.</p>

<p>Three tan yards and five currying shops, manufacture
about thirty thousand dollars worth of leather every year.</p>

<p>There is one excellent umbrella manufactury, one brush,
one reed, four chair, and two tobacco manufacturies which
make chewing tobacco, snuff and cigars. Three blue-dyers.
Five hatters, who employ upwards of fifty hands,
and manufacture about thirty thousand dollars worth of fur
and wool hats annually. Ten tailors, who employ forty-seven
journeymen and apprentices. Fifteen shoe and boot
makers, who employ about sixty hands, and manufacture
to the amount of about thirty thousand dollars yearly; and
two stocking weavers.</p>

<p>Two brew-houses make as good beer as can be got in
the United States. A carding machine for {165} wool, is a
great convenience to the manufacturers of that article.
There is one manufacturer of baling cloth for cotton wool,
who employs thirty-eight hands, and makes thirty-six thousand
yards annually; and two cotton spinning machines,
worked by horses, yield a handsome profit to the proprietors.
An oil mill, worked by horses, makes fifteen hundred
gallons of oil per year. Seven distilleries make near
seven thousand gallons of spirits yearly. Four rope-walks
employ about sixty hands, and make about three hundred
tons of cordage annually, the tar for which is made on the
banks of Sandy river, and is bought in Lexington at from
eighteen to twenty-five cents per gallon. There are two
apothecaries’ shops, and five regular physicians. Twenty-two
stores retail upwards of three hundred thousand dollars
worth of imported, foreign merchandize annually; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>there is one book and stationary store on a very large scale,
and two printing offices, where gazettes are printed weekly.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In the neighbourhood are six powder mills, that make
about twenty thousand pounds of powder yearly.</p>

<p>There are seven brick yards which employ sixty hands,
and make annually two million five hundred thousand
bricks; and there are fifty bricklayers, and as many attendants,
who have built between thirty and forty good brick
houses each of the last three years. The Presbyterian
society is now finishing a church which will cost eight thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>Manufactures are progressing in several parts of the state.</p>

<p>In Madison county there has lately been established a
manufactury on a large scale for spinning hemp and flax.
It is wrought by water, and is calculated to keep in motion
twelve hundred spindles, each of which will spin per day,
half a pound of thread of fineness to make from six to ten
hundred linen, or {166} four pounds per spindle suitable for
cotton baling. One hundred and sixty spindles are now at
work, which have spun a quantity of thread of superiour
quality.</p>

<p>Having been informed that Mr. Prentice, from New
England, who is keeper of the county gaol, had collected
much local information respecting Lexington, with an
intention of publishing an account of its settlement, progress
and present state, I called on him, and he very politely
communicated to me every thing I interrogated him on:
as his book however will be given to the publick on some
future day, I will not anticipate it; but will merely mention
one circumstance as a proof how much luxury has progressed
here. Last year there were in Lexington thirty-nine two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>wheel carriages, such as gigs and one horse chaises, valued
at 5764 dollars, and twenty-one four wheel ones, coaches,
chariots, &amp;c. valued at 8900 dollars; since when four elegant
ones have been added to the number. This may convey
some idea of the taste for shew and expense which pervades
this country. There are now here, fifteen hundred good
and valuable horses, and seven hundred milk cows.</p>

<p>The police of Lexington seems to be well regulated: as
one proof of which there is an established nightly watch.</p>

<p>The copper coinage of the United States is of no use in
Kentucky—the smallest circulating coin being a silver sixteenth
of a dollar.</p>

<p>There are four billiard tables in Lexington, and cards are
a good deal played at taverns, where it is more customary
to meet for that purpose than at private houses.</p>

<p>There is a coffee house here, where is a reading room
for the benefit of subscribers and strangers, in which are
forty-two files of different newspapers from various parts of
the United States. It is supported {167} by subscribers, who
pay six dollars each annually, and of which there are now
sixty. In the same house is a billiard table, and chess and
back-gammon tables, and the guests may be accommodated
with wine, porter, beer, spirituous liquors, cordials and confectionary.
It is kept by a Mr. Terasse, formerly of the
island of St. Bartholomew. He had been unfortunate in
mercantile business in the West Indies, and coming to this
country, and failing in the recovery of some property he
had shipped to New York, he had no other resource left to
gain a provision for his family, but the teaching of the French
language and dancing, in Lexington. The trustees of
Transylvania college (or university, as the Lexington people
proudly call it) employed him in the former, but had it not
been for the latter, he might have starved. And here it may
not be impertinent to remark, that in most parts of the United
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>States, teachers of dancing, meet with more encouragement
than professors of any species of literary science.—Disgusted
at length with the little encouragement he received,
he bethought himself of his present business, in which he
has become useful to the town and seems to be reaping a
plentiful harvest from his ingenuity. He has opened a
little publick garden behind his house, which he calls
Vauxhall. It has a most luxuriant grape arbour, and two
or three summer houses, formed also of grape vines, all of
which are illuminated with variegated lamps, every Wednesday
evening, when the musick of two or three decent performers
sometimes excites parties to dance on a small
boarded platform in the middle of the arbour. It is becoming
a place of fashionable resort.</p>

<p>We left Lexington after dinner, and taking the left hand
road of two equally used to Frankfort, we travelled twelve
miles through a very rich, but not a generally settled country.</p>

<p>After crossing the Town branch, Wolfe’s fork, Steele’s
run, and the South branch of Elkhorn river, to which the
three former are auxiliaries, and on all of which are several
mills, we arrived at a hamlet of three or four houses called
Leesburgh, twelve miles from Lexington.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> One of the
houses had been the seat of the late Col. Lee, and is still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>owned by his widow, who rents it to a mulatto man named
Daly, who has converted it into an excellent inn. With
the house, Daly occupies as much cultivated land as nearly
supplies his well frequented stables with hay, corn and oats.
There is also a good kitchen garden in which are vast
quantities of culinary sweet herbs, besides useful vegetables,
and he has good stabling and other out offices—for all
which he pays only forty pounds Virginia currency, or one
hundred and thirty-six dollars and two thirds, per annum.
We experienced the benefit of his spacious icehouse, in the
fine butter we had at supper, where every thing was good,
particularly the coffee, which was almost <i>a la Française</i>.
Daly having a good violin, on which he plays by ear with
some taste, he entertained us with musick while we supped,
in return for which, we played for him afterwards some
duets, by the aid {169} of another violin, borrowed of young
Mr. Lee, who resides in the neighbourhood with his mother.</p>

<p>My good bed did not lull me to repose, partly from the
strength of our host’s coffee, and partly from a stomachick
affection through indigestion.</p>

<p>After a sleepless night, the freshness of the morning
air revived me, and we proceeded towards Frankfort,
amusing ourselves by the way with talking over the vanity
and egotism of Mr. Daly, who had entertained us with many
little anecdotes, connected with some of the first and most
celebrated characters in the United States, in which he was
always a principal actor. His vanity however had met with
a sad check, soon after our alighting at his house, from the
abuse of a female negro slave from a neighbouring plantation,
who he drove away with a cowskin, and she in return
lavished on him the most opprobrious epithets, among
which he seemed to be most hurt by her calling him “an
Indian looking and a black son of a b—.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>
<p>A fine road, through a more level country than we had
came through last evening, brought us in two hours, eleven
miles, to the hill above Frankfort, which from thence was
seen to advantage, with Kentucky river flowing past it,
through a deep and narrow valley, confined by steep and
rather stony hills, which afford a variety, after the fine
plains, luxuriant forests and rich farms, within twenty miles
in every direction of Lexington.</p>

<p>We descended the hill, into the capital of Kentucky, and
stopped at Weiseger’s, the sign of the Golden Eagle, where
we sat down to a sumptuous breakfast, with two green silk
air fans kept in motion over our heads, by a little negro
girl with a string from the ceiling, in a room seventy-two
feet long.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>After breakfast I accompanied Mr. A—— to examine
a shallow stratum of sand, on the bank of the river, near a
mineral spring about half a mile below {170} the town, and
he got a negro who was fishing, to wade to an island opposite,
and bring some from thence, which had probably accumulated
there by floods.—He pronounced both kinds proper
for the manufacture of glass, which was what he had in
view, but it did [not] seem as if a sufficient quantity could be
procured for an extensive manufactury.</p>

<p>We then returned to town, walked through it, and entered
the state house, from the cupola of which we could distinctly
count every house, the number of which was exactly ninety,
most of them well built with brick, and some with rough but
good marble of a dusky cream colour, veined with both
blue and red, and capable of a good polish, which is abundant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>in the neighbourhood. The old wooden houses are
rapidly disappearing to give place to brick, since about two
years ago. Until that time, attempts had been made at
every annual sitting of the legislature, to remove the seat
of government elsewhere, ever since the year 1793, the first
after the separation of this government from the state of
Virginia. These attempts having failed, and there having
been no renewals of them in the last two sessions of the legislature,
the proprietors, under a security of Frankfort being
established as the permanent capital of the state, have
become spirited in improvement, and the buildings erected
since are on a scale and of materials worthy of a capital.</p>

<p>The publick buildings here, are a state-house, a court-house,
a gaol, a market-house, the state penitentiary, and a
government house occupied by Mr. Greenup, who now
holds that office.</p>

<p>The state-house of rough marble, is about eighty-six feet
front, by fifty-four deep. It is an oblong square with a
square roof, and a cupola containing a bell rising from the
centre. The house is plain, but roomy and commodious.
On the first floor are the treasurer’s, register’s, auditor’s,
and printing offices. {171} On the second, the rooms for
the representatives of the state, and the federal court of
appeals, and on the third are the senate chamber, the general
court and a school room.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The court-house is a plain brick building near the state-house.—A
piazza of five arches opens on the hall for the
county courts.—The clerk’s offices are on the same floor.—The
jury rooms are on the second floor, and on the third is a
mason’s lodge.</p>

<p>There are four publick inns, which in point of size, accommodation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>and attendance, are not surpassed in the United
States, and there are several large houses, where people
under the necessity of attending the courts, or detained for
any time in Frankfort, can be accommodated with private
lodgings. The erection of a permanent wooden bridge over
the Kentucky has been lately commenced, which will be
about one hundred and forty yards long from bank to bank,
the surface of which is about fifty feet above low water
mark. The present bridge of boats is about sixty-five yards
between the abutments, and the river now at low water is
eighty-seven yards wide. Three brigs have been built
above the bridge, and sent down the Kentucky, the Ohio,
and the Mississippi, but the Kentucky is not navigable
during the low water of summer and fall. Coals are brought
down it nearly three hundred miles and delivered in Frankfort
at sixpence per bushel, but wood being yet tolerably
plenty, they are used only in the penitentiary and by the
blacksmiths.</p>

<p>There are several curious strata of marble, rising from
the margin of the river, like steps of stairs, towards the top
of the bank on the town side. The marble is covered by a
stratum of blue limestone, which has {172} over it a superstratum
of reddish clay and gravel mixed.</p>

<p>After dinner we visited the penitentiary accompanied by
our landlord and Mr. William Hunter, a respectable printer
and bookseller, and a genteel man, to whom I had brought
a letter of introduction.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In our way we passed the government
house, which is a good, plain, two story, brick building,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>and near it we met governour Greenup, who saluted us with
much familiarity. He is a plain, respectable looking elderly
man, much esteemed throughout the state.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The penitentiary is contained within a square area of an
acre, consequently each side is two hundred and eight feet
long. The work shops and store houses occupy the front
and the other three sides are enclosed by a stone wall sixteen
feet high, surmounted by a sort of entablature of brick about
three feet high, rounded on the top and projecting about a
foot from the wall on each side to prevent any attempts of
the convicts to scale the wall. There are now twenty-four
miserable wretches confined here for various limitations of
time, in proportion to the enormity of their crimes, but none
exceeding ten years, the longest period limited by law. The
cells of the criminals are in a two story building with a gallery
on the inside of the area, extending the length of one of the
sides. Some of the convicts were playing fives, and the
rest amusing themselves otherwise in the yard. It was
Sunday, a day always devoted to amusement by those outcasts
of society, who have their daily task exacted from them
with rigour during the rest of the week. They are taught,
and work at every trade for which they have a taste, and
of which they are capable, so that some who were useless
burthens on society previous to their confinement, carry
with them, on their return to the world, the means of earning
a decent subsistence; though at {173} the same time, perhaps
the majority, instead of being reformed, become more prone
to vice, through despair of ever gaining their lost reputation.
The institution had like to have failed about two years ago,
through the insufficiency of the superintendants, when a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>captain Taylor, a man of good property in Mercer county,
who was an enthusiastick admirer of it, was prevailed on by
the governour to undertake the management and superintendance,
and it has since not only supported itself, but has
earned a surplus, which goes into the state treasury. Taylor
is a stern man of steady habits, and a great mechanical
genius. He superintends every class of workmen himself,
and has invented several machines for the improvement of
mechanicks. He has nailors, coopers, chair makers, turners,
and stone cutters, the latter of whom cut and polish marble
slabs of all sizes, and he has taught most of them himself.</p>

<p>He is a large and strong man, about fifty years of age,
and either through eccentricity, or to give himself a terrifick
appearance, he wears his dark brown beard about two
inches long, from each ear round the lower part of the chin.
It is surely a strange taste, which prompts him to separate
himself from his family and the world, to exercise a petty
tyranny over felons, and to live in such constant apprehension
from them, that, as I was informed, he always carries
pistols.</p>

<p>We resisted the polite and friendly importunity of Mr.
Hunter, to spend the day with him, and quitting Frankfort,
we took a different route to that by which we had come,
which brought us, after riding ten miles mostly through
woods, to Coles’s, who keeps an inn on this road, in opposition
to Daly, on the other. But any traveller, who has once
contrasted his rough vulgarity, and the badness of his table
and accommodations, with the taste, order, plenty, and good
attendance of his mulatto competitor, will {174} never trouble
Mr. Coles a second time, especially as there is no sensible
difference in the length or goodness of the roads, and that
by Daly’s, is through a generally much better settled country.</p>

<p>We got back to Lexington on Monday, 3d August, in
time for breakfast, which I partook of at the publick table
of the Traveller’s Inn, merely for curiosity, but notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>the apparent elegance of the house, my other landlord’s
(Wilson) suffered nothing in the comparison.</p>

<p>I whiled away the day in expectation of the post, which
was to decide whether or not I should have the pleasure of
my friend A——’s company on my return to Pittsburgh,
but owing to some unaccountable irregularity, which is a
cause of general complaint in this country against the post-office
department, it did not arrive until ten at night, although
it was due at eleven in the morning. Another very
just cause of complaint against the same department is the
slowness with which the mail is conveyed. A trifling improvement
and a very small additional expence, would forward
the mails through the whole western country, where
the roads are comparatively good, and the climate very fine,
at the rate of fifty or sixty miles a day, except during floods
in the winter, where, for want of bridges, the roads are sometimes
impassable in particular spots for a few days, whereas,
now, in the best season, the average progress of the mails,
does not exceed thirty miles daily.</p>

<p>Mr. A—— having an engagement, the day would have
passed very heavily, had it not been for the coffee house,
where I amused myself with the wonderful mass of political
contradiction to be found in forty different newspapers,
where scarcely any two editors coincided in opinion.</p>

<p>I left Lexington on Tuesday the 4th August, by a different
road to that by which I had first entered it, now taking the
stage and post road direct to Paris.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>
<p>The morning was fine, the road good, and the country well
settled and improved, but the want of the company of my
worthy friend A——, to which I had now been so long accustomed,
was felt by me so sensibly as to make the miles
appear uncommonly long.</p>

<p>At four miles I passed a celebrated old military post,
called Bryan’s station, where the first settlers of the state,
repelled a desperate attack of the Indians, who soon after
in their turn, ambushed and cut off Col. Todd’s little army
at the Blue licks, as before mentioned. This post is now
the pleasant seat and fine farm of a Mr. Rogers.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>I soon after overtook an Irishman named Gray, who was
one of the first settlers. He rode two miles with me, and was
intelligent and communicative. He informed me that the
usual produce of an acre of this wonderfully luxuriant soil,
is from forty to fifty bushels of shelled corn, or from twenty
to thirty-seven of wheat clean from the threshing floor. And
here I must observe, that I have not seen, nor heard of any
of the threshing machines now so common in the British
European Isles, in any part of America. As they save so
much labour, I am astonished that {176} they have not yet
made their way across the Atlantick.—They would be of
incalculable utility to the very wealthy farmers of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Crossing the North fork of Elkhorn, and Hewetson’s
branch of Licking, both good mill streams, I entered Paris,
eighteen miles from Lexington. It is situated on Stoner’s
fork of Licking, and contains eighty-seven dwelling houses
mostly good ones, several of them of brick, and six or seven
building.</p>

<p>It is compact, in three small parallel streets, with a square
in the centre, on which is a stone meeting house, a neat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>brick court-house, a small but strong gaol, and a market
house. It is the seat of justice of Bourbon county, and has
much appearance of prosperity. From the cupola of the
court-house, there is an extensive view of a very rich country
as far as the eye can reach in every direction, but though
it is a country of hills and dales, there is too great a sameness
to please the eye.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is not on the earth a naturally richer country
than the area of sixteen hundred square miles of which Lexington
is the centre, yet there is a something wanting to
please the eye of taste—a variety, like the fertile plains of
the Milanese, contrasted with the neighbouring Alpine
scenery, and studded with the noble lakes, and streaked
with the meandering rivers of that delightful region, which
has given such inimitable taste and execution to the pencils
of so many eminent painters.</p>

<p>It was the day of election for representatives in the
legislature of the state. The voting was very simple. The
county clerk sat within the bar of the court-house, and the
freeholders as they arrived, gave him their names and the
names of those they voted for, which he registered in a book.—That
done, the voter remounted his horse and returned to
his farm.</p>

<p>The hostler at Buchanan’s inn, where I stopped to
breakfast, is a free negro man named Frank Bird. {177} He
was formerly owned by the great and good Washington,
whom he accompanied and served in all his campaigns.
He had learned farriery, cooking and hairdressing in England
in his youth, so that he must have been a useful servant.
He was liberated and got some land near Mount
Vernon, by the general’s will, and now at the age of fifty-seven,
he is hostler here, and enjoys such health and strength,
that a few days ago he carried eight bushels of salt, exceeding
four hundred pounds weight. The old man repaid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>my complaisance in listening to him, by recounting as
much of his own memoirs as my time would permit me to
hear.</p>

<p>I left Paris, and passing Millersburgh, and one of the
first settlements, called the Irish station, four miles further,
just before entering the barren country three or four miles
on that side of Blue licks, I spurred my horse past Nicholasville
court-house and tavern, where I counted above a
hundred horses, fastened under trees. I was induced to
hasten past this place, as the voters in that sterile part of the
country did not appear quite so peaceable and orderly as
those I had seen in the morning at Paris, and I was not sure
but some of them might have been moved by the spirit of
whiskey to challenge me to run a race with them, or to
amuse the company with a game of rough and tumble, at
both which the backwoods Virginians are very dexterous.</p>

<p>I arrived at May’s-lick about sunset, much fatigued with
my ride of fifty-two miles, in one of the hottest days of the
season. I was very feverish, yet I forced myself, though
without appetite, to take a light supper, after which I bathed
my feet in warm water, and retired to bed, where I passed
a sleepless night in high fever and excessive thirst, which
being no ways abated at the first dawn of day, I arose and
called my host to prepare my horse, being determined not
to sink under my indisposition, while capable {178} of making
the smallest exertion. My flushed countenance, black
and parched lips, and frequent nausea, alarmed my host so
as to induce him to dissuade me to proceed, but finding me
decided he prescribed a strong infusion of tansey in Geneva—the
bitterness of which a little relieved my thirst, but did
not prevent its return accompanied by nausea and excruciating
headache, in which situation I arrived at Washington
at seven o’clock, and returned my horse to its hearty old
owner with the young fat wife.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>
<p>I reposed a while on a bed at my friendly host Ebert’s,
who as well as Mrs. Ebert, was truly kind and hospitable.</p>

<p>Apropos—That last word just reminds me of a remark
I have made in the course of my tour. I had letters of
introduction to some very respectable merchants in different
parts of this state, which were productive of some general
advice and information, but without my being invited further
into their houses than their shops, or (as they are called)
stores; or without having it in my power to excuse myself
from tasting their wine, cider, whiskey, or any thing else.
I must except Mr. Hunter of Frankfort, from this general
remark, and the polite invitation of general Russel on the
road, was a specimen of the hospitality of the country gentlemen,
which I have heard much boasted of, as brought
with them from Virginia; so that I cannot absolutely tax
Kentucky with a total want of that virtue.</p>

<p>After taking a couple of basons of strong coffee without
milk, I found myself much relieved, and proceeded on foot
to Maysville, where I arrived in something more than an
hour. The exercise of walking had restored my perspiration,
and after two hours repose at my host January’s, I
arose in a state of convalescence, sat down to the dinner
table, and forced myself to partake of a chicken—after
which I devoted the remainder of the day to quiet and reading
{179}—took a cup of coffee, retired early—had a good
night’s rest, and felt no more of my fever.</p>

<p>I am the more minute in describing my indisposition,
partly to warn other travellers, to avoid excessive fatigue
under a hot sun, and partly to shew the good effects to be
derived from fortitude and patience under most diseases. I
am persuaded that had I obeyed the dictates of my inclination,
and my landlord’s advice at May’s lick, I should have
experienced a most severe, and probably fatal attack of
highly inflammatory and bilious fever—but by bearing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>up against it—by perseverance in exercise and rest alternately—checking
my strong desire for liquids, and using
only such as were proper for me, and that moderately, and
especially by refraining from every thing which might have
the smallest tendency towards keeping up the heat of the
blood, with the exception of the tansey bitters at May’s
lick, I precluded the necessity of either medicine or professional
advice.</p>

<p>Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I was employed in
rambling about the woods, exploring and examining a tract
of land, of a thousand acres, in the state of Ohio, which I
had purchased when in Europe last year, and which had
been the principal cause of my present tour. As it was only
six miles from {180} Maysville, I crossed the Ohio and went
to it on foot. I had expected to have found a mere wilderness,
as soon as I should quit the high road, but to my agreeable
surprise, I found my land surrounded on every side by fine
farms, some of them ten years settled, and the land itself,
both in quality and situation, not exceeded by any in this fine
country. The population was also astonishing for the time
of the settlement, which a muster of the militia, while I
was there, gave me an opportunity of knowing—there
being reviewed a battalion of upwards of five hundred
effective men, most expert in the use of the rifle, belonging
to the district of ten miles square.</p>

<p>And now I experienced amongst these honest and friendly
farmers real hospitality, for they vied with each other in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>lodging me at their houses, and in giving me a hearty and
generous welcome to their best fare. Robert Simpson from
New Hampshire, and Daniel Ker and Thomas Gibson
from Pennsylvania, shall ever be entitled to my grateful
remembrance. I had no letters of introduction to them—I
had no claims on their hospitality, other than what any
other stranger ought to have.—But they were farmers,
and had not acquired those contracted habits, which I have
observed to prevail very generally amongst the traders in
this part of the world.</p>

<p>On Saturday I returned to Ellis’s ferry opposite Maysville,
to give directions for my baggage being sent after me
by the stage to Chilicothe.</p>

<p>On the bank of the Ohio I found squire Ellis seated on
a bench under the shade of two locust trees, with a table,
pen and ink, and several papers, holding a justice’s court,
which he does every Saturday.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>—Seven or eight men were
sitting on the bench with him, awaiting his awards in their
several cases.—When he had finished, which was soon after
I had taken a seat under the same shade, one of the men
invited the squire to drink with them, which he {181} consenting
to, some whiskey was provided from landlord Powers,
in which all parties made a libation to peace and justice.
There was something in the scene so primative and so
simple, that I could not help enjoying it with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>I took up my quarters for the night at Powers’s, who is
an Irishman from Ballibay, in the county of Monaghan.
He pays squire Ellis eight hundred dollars per annum for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>his tavern, fine farm and ferry. He and his wife were very
civil, attentive, and reasonable in their charges, and he
insisted much on lending me a horse to carry me the first six
miles over a hilly part of the road to Robinson’s tavern,
but I declined his kindness, and on Sunday morning, the
9th of August, after taking a delightful bath in the Ohio,
I quitted its banks. I walked on towards the N. E. along
the main post and stage road seventeen miles to West
Union,—the country becoming gradually more level as I
receded from the river, but not quite so rich in soil and timber.</p>

<p>The road was generally well settled, and the woods
between the settlements were alive with squirrels, and all
the variety of woodpeckers with their beautiful plumage,
which in one species is little inferiour to that of the bird of
Paradise, so much admired in the East Indies.</p>

<p>I stopped at twelve miles at the house of squire Leadham,
an intelligent and agreeable man, who keeps a tavern, and is
a justice of the peace. I chose bread and butter, eggs and
milk for breakfast, for which I tendered a quarter of a dollar,
the customary price, but he would receive only the half of
that sum, saying that even that was too much. Such instances
of modest and just honesty rarely occur.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>West Union is three years old since it was laid out for
the county town of Adams county. The lots of one
third of an acre in size, then sold for about seventy dollars
each. There were upwards of one {182} hundred lots,
which brought the proprietor above three thousand dollars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>It is in a healthy situation, on an elevated plain, and contains
twenty dwelling houses, including two taverns and three
stores. It has also a court-house and a gaol, in the former
of which divine service was performing when I arrived to a
numerous Presbyterian congregation. One of the houses
is well built with stone; one of the taverns is a large framed
house, and all the rest are formed of square logs, some of
which are two stories high and very good.</p>

<p>Having to get a deed recorded at the clerk’s office of the
county, which could not be done until Monday morning, I
stopt Sunday afternoon and night at West Union, where my
accommodations in either eating or sleeping, could not
boast of any thing beyond mediocrity.</p>

<p>Monday the 10th August, having finished my business
and breakfasted, I resumed my journey through a country
but indifferently inhabited, and at four miles and a half from
West Union, I stopped for a few minutes at Allen’s tavern, at
the request of a traveller on horseback, who had overtaken
and accompanied me for the last three miles. He was an
elderly man named Alexander, a cotton planter in the S. W.
extremity of North Carolina, where he owns sixty-four negro
slaves besides his plantation—all acquired by industry—he
having emigrated from Larne in Ireland, in early life,
with no property. He was now going to visit a brother-in-law
near Chilicothe. He had travelled upwards of five
hundred miles within the last three weeks on the same mare.
He had crossed the Saluda mountains, and the states of
Tennessee and Kentucky, and had found houses of accommodation
at convenient distances all along that remote
road, but provender so dear, that he had to pay in many
places a dollar for half a bushel of oats.</p>

<p>{183} Allen’s is a handsome, roomy, well finished stone
house, for which, with twenty acres of cleared land, he
pays a yearly rent of one hundred and ten dollars, to Andrew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>Ellison, near Manchester.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> He himself is four years from
Tanderagee, in the county Armagh, Ireland, from whence he
came with his family to inherit some property left him by a
brother who had resided in Washington, Kentucky, but two
hundred acres of land adjoining my tract near Maysville,
was all he had been able to obtain possession of, although
his brother had been reputed wealthy. I have met many
Europeans in the United States, who have experienced
similar disappointments.</p>

<p>My equestrian companion finding that I did not walk fast
enough for him, parted from me soon after we left Allen’s.
At two miles from thence I came to Brush creek, a beautiful
river about sixty yards wide. A new state road crosses the
river here, but as I had been informed, that there was no
house on it for ten miles, I preferred keeping up the bank of
the river on the stage road, which led through a beautiful
but narrow unsettled bottom, with Brush creek on the right,
and a steep, craggy precipice on the left, for a mile and a
half. I then ascended and descended a steep and barren
ridge for a mile, when I forded the creek to Jacob Platter’s
finely situated tavern and farm on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Having rested and taken some refreshment, the growling
of distant thunder warned me to hasten my journey, as I
had five miles through the woods to the next habitation.
The road was fine and level,—the gust approached with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>terrifick warning—one flash of lightning succeeding another
in most rapid succession, so that the woods frequently
appeared as in a flame, and several trees were struck in every
direction around me, one being shattered within fifty paces
on my right, while the thunder without intermission of an
instant was heard in every variety of {184} sound, from the
deafening burst, shaking the whole surrounding atmosphere
to the long solemn cadence always interrupted by a new
and more heavy peal before it had reached its pause. This
elemental war would have been sublimely awful to me, had I
been in an open country, but the frequent crash of the
falling bolts on the surrounding trees, gave me such incessant
warnings of danger, that the sublimity was lost in the
awe. I had been accustomed to thunder storms in every
climate, and I had heard the roar of sixty ships of the line
in battle, but I never before was witness to so tremenduous
an elemental uproar. I suppose the heaviest part of the electrick
cloud was impelled upon the very spot I was passing.</p>

<p>I walked the five miles within an hour, but my speed
did not avail me to escape a torrent of rain which fell during
the last mile, so that long before I arrived at the hospitable
dwelling of the Pennsylvania hunter who occupied the next
cabin, I was drenched and soaked most completely. I
might have sheltered myself from some of the storm under
the lee side of a tree, had not the wind, which blew a hurricane,
varied every instant—but independent of that, I
preferred moving along the road to prevent a sudden chill;
besides, every tree being a conductor, there is greater danger
near the trunk of one, than in keeping in a road, however
narrow, which has been marked by the trees having been cut
down.</p>

<p>My host and his family had come here from the back
part of Pennsylvania only last May, and he had already a
fine field of corn and a good deal of hay. He had hitherto
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>been more used to the chase than to farming, and he boasted
much of his rifle. He recommended his Pennsylvania
whiskey as an antidote against the effects of my ducking,
and I took him at his word, though he was much surprised
to see me use more of it externally than internally, which I
did from experience that bathing the feet, hands and head
{185} with spirituous liquor of any sort, has a much better
effect in preventing chill and fever, either after being wet
of after violent perspiration from exercise, than taking any
quantity into the stomach, which on the contrary rarely
fails to bring on, or to add to inflammatory symptoms.—A
little internally however I have found to be a good aid to the
external application.</p>

<p>I found at my friendly Pennsylvanian’s, a little old man
named Lashley, who had taken shelter at the beginning of
the gust, which being now over, he buckled on his knapsack,
and we proceeded together. He had travelled on foot from
Tennessee river, through a part of the state of Tennessee,
quite across Kentucky, and so far in Ohio in nine days, at
the rate of thirty-six miles a day. He had assisted in navigating
a boat from Indian Wheeling, where he lived, to
Tennessee, for which he had got thirty dollars, ten of which
he had already expended on his journey so far back, though
using the utmost economy. He remarked to me, that
although he was upwards of sixty years of age, and apparently
very poor, he had not got gratuitously a single meal
of victuals in all that route. Are not hospitality and
charity more nominal than real virtues?</p>

<p>The country for the next five miles is tolerably well improved,
and there is a good brick house which is a tavern
owned by one Wickerham at the first mile, and a mile
further is Horn’s tavern, where the stage sleeps on its route
to the N. E. towards Chilicothe.</p>

<p>Old Lashley complaining of fatigue, we stopped at Marshon’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>farm house, ten miles from Brush creek, where finding
that we could be accommodated for the night, we agreed
to stay, and were regaled with boiled corn, wheaten griddle
cake, butter and milk for supper, which our exercise through
the day gave us good appetites for, but I did not enjoy my
bed so {186} much as my supper, notwithstanding it was the
second best in the house, for besides that it was not remarkable
for its cleanliness, I was obliged to share it with my old
companion; fatigue however soon reconciled me to it, and I
slept as well as if I had lain on down between lawn sheets.</p>

<p>Marshon is from the Jerseys, he has a numerous family
grown up, and is now building a large log house on which
he means to keep a tavern. Three of his sons play the violin
by ear—they had two shocking bad violins, one of which
was of their own manufacture, on which they scraped away
without mercy to entertain us, which I would most gladly
have excused, though I attempted to seem pleased, and I
believe succeeded in making them think I was so.</p>

<p>The land is here the worst I had seen since I had left
the banks of the Ohio; it had been gradually worse from
about two miles behind squire Leadham’s, and for the last
two miles before we come to Marshon’s it had degenerated
into natural prairies or savannas, with very little wood,
and none deserving the name of timber, but well clothed
with brush and low coarse vegetation.</p>

life. Authorities differ in details; we follow the tradition handed down in the family.
Andrew Ellison, born in 1755, came to Kentucky as a young man, and in 1790
accompanied Massie into Ohio, settling near Manchester. One day in 1793,
while at work on his farm, he was surprised and captured by a band of Indians.
Pursuit failing to overtake them, Ellison was carried to the Chillicothe towns where
in running the gauntlet he was severely beaten. Later being taken to Detroit, he
was ransomed for a blanket by an English officer, and being supplied with food
and clothing walked back across the state of Ohio, arriving at his home in the early
autumn. Four years later, he took up a large tract of land on Brushy Creek,
building thereon a stone house—one of the best in the state at that time.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>On Tuesday morning the 11th August, we arose with
the dawn, and notwithstanding there was a steady small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>rain, we pursued our journey, having first paid Marshon
fully as much for our simple and coarse accommodations,
as the best on the road would have cost, but our host I suppose
thought his stories and his son’s musick were equivalent
for all other deficiencies.</p>

<p>The land was poor, and no house on the road until we
arrived at Heistant’s tavern, four miles from Marshon’s,
where we met the Lexington stage.</p>

<p>My morning walk had given me an appetite for breakfast,
which my fellow traveller not being willing to be at
the expence of, declined, and saying that as I walked so
much faster than him I would soon overtake him, he went
on, intending to satisfy his stomach occasionally with some
bread and cheese from his knapsack, and a drop of whiskey
from his tin canteen, from which he had made a libation at
first setting out, and had seemed surprised at my refusal of
his invitation to partake.</p>

<p>Heistant is a Pennsylvania German, and has a good and
plentiful house, in a very pleasant situation, called the
Sinking springs, from a great natural curiosity near it.
On the side of a low hill, now in cultivation, are three large
holes, each about twenty feet deep and twenty feet diameter,
about sixty paces apart, with a subterraneous communication
by which the water is conveyed from one to the other,
and issues in a fine rivulet at a fourth opening near the
{188} house, where Heistant’s milk house is placed very
judiciously. The spring is copious and the water very
fine.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>After a good breakfast I walked on alone, and at about a
mile, I entered on a dreary forest having first passed Irwin’s
tavern, a pleasant situation where the stage sleeps going
towards the S. westward. Three miles from Irwin’s, is
over very broken, but well timbered hills, to the left of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>on Brush creek, I was informed, that there is a fine settlement,
but it is not in sight of the road. The next two
miles was through a beech bottom, which was rendered so
miry by the rain that poured on me all the time, that it was
most laborious walking through it. About the middle of it,
I met three men in hunting shirts with each an axe in his
hand. Their appearance in that solitary situation was no
ways agreeable; however, we gave each other good day, and
they told me that old Lashley had desired them to inform
me that he would await me at Bradley’s, the next house, but
when I came there, he had just departed, so that I might
have very soon overtaken him, had I not preferred being
alone, to effect which the more certainly, I stopped to rest,
as it was a house of private entertainment. Bradley and his
wife are about sixteen years from Stewartstown, county
Tyrone in Ireland, and have a daughter lately married to a
young shoemaker named Irons at the next cabin, where I
stopped to get my shoes mended. I here found a dozen of
stout young fellows who had been at work repairing the
road, and were now sheltering themselves from the increasing
storm, and listening to some indifferent musick made by
their host on a tolerably good violin. I proposed taking
the violin while he repaired my shoes. He consented
and sat down to work, and in a few minutes I had all
the lads jigging it on the floor merrily; Irons himself, as
soon as he had repaired the shoes, jumping up and joining
them.</p>

<p>{189} Seeing no prospect of the storm ceasing, I satisfied
my shoemaker for his trouble, with something more agreeable
to him than my musick, and then set off to reach Talbot’s,
said to be a good tavern, three miles further.</p>

<p>The road led over the highest hill which I had yet seen
since I left the Ohio, and afterwards through a level, well
wooded, but thinly inhabited country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>
<p>In an hour I was at Talbot’s, which is a good two story
house of squared logs, with a large barn and excellent
stabling, surrounded by a well opened and luxuriant farm,
with a fine run of meadow.</p>

<p>The landlord and his family are seven years from Nenagh
in the county Tipperary, and is the first Irish settler, I
had seen on my tour, from any other part than the north of
Ireland. He had kept Ellis’s ferry on the Ohio, where
Powers now resides, for some years, and has lately
rented this house and farm from Mr. Willis of Chilicothe,
the contractor for carrying the mail from Wheeling to Lexington.</p>

<p>Observing a new stage wagon in the yard, my host informed
me that it was one which Mr. Willis intended in a
few days to commence running between Chilicothe and
Ellis’s ferry, so that it, and the one already established, will
each run once a week on different days.</p>

<p>I shifted my wet clothes, and then (there being no doctor
nearer than Chilicothe, twenty-four miles) prescribed medicine
and regimen for Talbot’s little daughter, who was
suffering under a severe and dangerous attack of a nervous
fever.</p>

<p>Three young men on horseback arrived soon after me,
and were shewn into the same room. They talked a little
largely, according to a very common custom among young
travellers, intimating that they were just returning from the
Olympian springs in Kentucky, a place of very fashionable
resort, where they had been on a party of pleasure, and where
they {190} had attended more to cards, billiards, horse
jockeying, &amp;c. than to the use of the waters for medicinal
purposes. I am however much mistaken, if they had not
been travelling on business, and took the opportunity of
visiting those celebrated springs, which are the Bath of
Kentucky, and which they now affected to speak of as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>sole cause of their journey.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> I listened with much amusement
to their dashing conversation, knowing tolerably well
how to estimate it, in a country where vanity in the young
and ambition among the more advanced in life are predominant
features. I do not confine this remark to the state of
Ohio, where probably there is less of either than in the older
states, in which, particularly to the southward of New England,
they seem to be national characteristics.</p>

<p>We supped together and were then shewn to our beds
by the landlord, who probably thought that the custom of
two in a bed was general in America, by his shewing the
whole four into a room with two beds: I followed him however
down stairs, and soon had a good bed prepared for me
in a room by myself.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning the 12th August, I proceeded
through a wilderness of fine land well adapted for cultivation,
and finely timbered to Bainbridge, a hamlet of eight
cabins, a large stone house building, a blacksmith shop, a
post-office, and a store kept by William Daly for Humphrey
Fullerton of Chilicothe. Daly told me that he had a
good deal of business for the five months he had been here,
there being a populous and well cultivated country in the
neighbourhood on Buckskin and Paint creeks, at the falls
of the latter of which, about a mile to the northward of
Bainbridge are some of the best mills in the state, owned
by Gen. Massey, who is also proprietor of Bainbridge,
which he laid out for a town about a year ago, selling the
lots at about thirty dollars each.</p>

<p>{191} The reason assigned for the lands being generally
so badly settled along the roads, is, that they belong to wealthy
proprietors, who either hold them at a very high price, or
will not divide them into convenient sized farms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>From Bainbridge to Reeves’s on the bank of Paint creek,
is through a fine well wooded level, with hills in sight from
every opening in the woods, about a mile distant. I passed
a finger post on the left, a mile from Bainbridge, pointing
to the westward and directing to Cincinnatti seventy-three
miles, and immediately after I left Platter’s tavern and well
cultivated farm on the right, a little beyond which is a
school-house, where I observed the schoolmaster, an Irish
looking old man, with silver grey locks and barefooted, his
whole appearance, and that of the cabin which was the
school, indicating but little encouragement for the disseminating
of instruction.</p>

<p>A mile from Platter’s I stopped at Reeves’s, where I had
been informed I could be well accommodated, although
it was not a tavern, and I proved my information to be correct,
as I immediately got the breakfast I asked for, excellent
bread, and rich milk, neatly served, in a large handsome
and clean room, for which it was with difficulty I could prevail
on Mrs. Reeves to accept any recompence.</p>

<p>This house is charmingly situated near the bank of Paint
creek, and was the best I had seen since I entered the state
of Ohio, it being spacious, of two lofty stories, and well
built with very handsome stone. It is surrounded on all
sides by a noble and well improved farm, which nine years
ago, when Reeves came here from Washington in Pennsylvania,
was a wilderness. He built his handsome house about
five years ago, and at some distance on the bank of the
creek, he has a large tanyard and leather shop, from
whence one of his men, ferried me across the creek in a
canoe.</p>

<p>{192} Paint creek is a beautiful little river about forty
yards wide, running easterly to join the Scioto near Chilicothe.</p>

<p>My walk from hence to the north fork of Paint creek,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>was a most fatiguing one, being thirteen miles, mostly along
a very rich bottom, with the creek on the right, and steep
hills on the left, over spurs of which the road sometimes
leads, which was always a relief to me, after wading for
miles through the mud below. This tract is tolerably well
settled, the soil being esteemed as rich as any in the state.
At eleven miles from Reeves’s, is a hamlet of six or seven
cabins called Cat-tail swamp, and two miles further I came
to Rogers’s on the bank of the north fork of Paint.</p>

<p>Reeves’s appears to be the best land and the best improved
farm on this side the Ohio, but Rogers’s, nearly as good a
soil, is I think superiour in beauty of situation. The house
which is a story and a half high is of square logs, and commodious
enough for a farm house. It is on a moderately
high bank, from whence they descend to the river by a flight
of wooden steps, at the foot of which is a most beautiful
spring which flows into a cask sunk on purpose, and from
thence is conveyed by a small spout into the river, whose bank
is guarded by a natural wall of soft slate, which I think
could be easily wrought into good covering for houses.
Nature has formed natural stairs of the slate, by which one
may descend to any depth into the river for bathing, washing
linen, or for any purpose which may be necessary, in proportion
as the river rises or falls. A swimmer may also
enjoy that invigorating exercise charmingly, as though the
river is only about thirty yards wide, it is at this place
sufficiently deep, and the current is moderate. Rogers
has been here about nine years from Virginia, and was one
of the first settlers in this part of the country.</p>

<p>{193} I supped and slept here, and next morning, Thursday
the 13th August, after refreshing by swimming in the
river, I pursued my way to Chilicothe four miles, the first
mile and half of which was over a chain of moderately high
and not very steep hills of a tolerably good soil, to colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>M’Arthur’s elegant stone house and noble farm.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The
other two miles and a half was through a level plain, passing
a neat house and handsome improvement of Mr. Henry
Massey’s, just before entering Chilicothe, which I did at
eight o’clock, stopping at Muker’s tavern, as the breakfast
bell rang, which summoned seventeen or eighteen boarders
and travellers to an excellent breakfast with good attendance,
to which I did ample justice, after my bath and walk.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent1">The Scioto—Chilicothe—Indian monument—Fine prospect—Colonel
M’Arthur’s—Colonel Worthington’s.</p>
</div>


<p>Chilicothe, which signifies town in most of the Indian
dialects, is most beautifully situated on the right bank of
the Scioto, about forty-five miles by land, and nearly seventy
following its meanders from the confluence of that river
with the Ohio, between Portsmouth and Alexandria. In all
that distance the river has a gentle current, and unimpeded
navigation for large keels, and other craft for four feet
draught of water. It continues navigable for smaller
boats and batteaux upwards of one hundred miles above
Chilicothe, towards its source to the northward, from whence
it glides gently through a naturally rich, level, and rapidly
improving country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>
<p>{194} The situation of the town, which is the capital of
the state,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> is on an elevated and extensive plain of nearly
ten thousand acres of as fine a soil as any in America,
partly in cultivation and partly covered with its native forests.</p>

<p>This plain is nearly surrounded by the Scioto, which
turning suddenly to the N. E. from its general southerly
course, leaves the town to the southward of it, and then
forms a great bend to the eastward and southward.</p>

<p>Water street which runs about E. by N. parallel to the
Scioto, is half a mile long, and contains ninety houses. It
is eighty-four feet wide, and would be a fine street, had not
the river floods caved in the bank in one place near the middle,
almost into the centre of it. There is now a lottery
on foot, to raise money for securing the bank against any
further encroachments of the river. Main street, parallel
to Water street, is one hundred feet wide, as is Market street
which crosses both at right angles, and in which is the
market-house, a neat brick building eighty feet long. The
court-house in the same street is neatly built of freestone,
on an area of forty-five by forty-two feet, with a semicircular
projection in the rear, in which is the bench for the
judges. It has an octangular belfry rising from the roof,
painted white with green lattices, which is an ornament to
the town, as is the small plain belfry of the Presbyterian
meeting-house, a handsome brick building in Main street;
in which street also is a small brick Methodist meeting-house.
These are the only places of publick worship in
the town, if I except the court-house, which is used occasionally
by the Episcopalians and other sects.</p>

<p>{195} The whole number of dwelling houses in Chilicothe,
as I counted them, is two hundred and two, besides four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>brick and a few framed ones now building. I reckoned only
six taverns with signs, which small proportion of houses of
that description, speaks volumes in favour of the place.
There are fourteen stores, a post-office, and two printing-offices,
which each issues a gazette weekly.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The scite of the town being on a gravelly soil, the streets
are generally clean. The houses are of freestone, brick,
or timber clapboarded, the first of which is got in the
neighbourhood, is of a whitish brown colour, and excellent
for building. They are mostly very good and are well
painted.</p>

<p>On the whole I think Chilicothe is not exceeded in beauty
of plan, situation, or appearance, by any town I have seen in
the western part of the United States.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable Indian monument in Mr. Watchup’s
garden in the very heart of the town.—Like that at
Grave creek, it is circular at the base, about seventy or
eighty feet diameter, but differs from that, by being round,
instead of flat on the top, which has an elevation of about
thirty feet perpendicular from the level of the plain. It is
formed of clay, and though it has been perforated by the
proprietor, nothing has been found to justify the common
opinion of these mounts having been barrows or cemeteries.
They talk of having it levelled, as it projects a little into
Market street, but I think it a pity to destroy any of the
very few vestiges of aboriginal population, which this
country presents to the curious and inquisitive traveller.</p>

<p>From a steep hill, about three hundred feet perpendicular
height, just outside the western extremity of the town, is a
most charming view of the streets immediately below, under
the eye like a plan on paper: Then the Scioto, from one
hundred to one hundred {196} and fifty yards wide, winding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>on the left, and some low hills about two miles beyond it
terminating the view, to the N. E. while to the eastward and
westward, as far as the eye can reach both ways, is spread
a country, partly flat, and partly rising in gentle swells,
which if cultivation proceeds in equal proportion, to what
it has done since Chilicothe was first laid out about ten
years ago, must, in a very short time present one of the
finest landscapes imaginable.</p>

<p>Colonel M’Arthur coming to town was polite enough to
invite me to take a bed at his house, which I had passed about
two miles back in the morning. I found the situation surpassed
what I had thought of it then, when I only saw it from
the road, it commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect
including the town of Chilicothe, which, however is now seen
rather indistinctly on account of the foliage of some trees
on the brow of a small projecting hill, which will probably
soon be cut down.</p>

<p>Next morning, Friday, 14th August, I walked before
breakfast half a mile through the woods to the northward,
to an elegant seat belonging to Col. Worthington.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> It will
be finished in a few weeks and will be one of the best and
most tasty houses not only of this state, but to the westward
of the Allegheny mountains. It is about sixty feet square,
with a square roof, and two large receding wings. It has
two lofty stories, with six rooms on each floor, and cellars
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>and vaults beneath. The wings contain kitchen, scullery,
apartments for servants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Like colonel M’Arthur’s it is built with freestone, but the
stone of the front is all hewn and squared, like the generality
of the houses in the new part of Glasgow in Scotland, the
stone being very similar both in colour and quality. The
situation is like Col. M’Arthur’s, being on the brow of the
same ridge of hills, and affording nearly the same prospects.
Both houses were built by two young Virginians of the
{197} name of Morris, who are almost self taught masons
and architects, and whose work and style does them much
credit.</p>

<p>I returned to town on Friday after breakfast, and dined,
supped and slept at Muker’s, which is a very good and well
frequented inn, and at five o’clock on Saturday the 15th
August, I left Chilicothe in the stage with a Mr. M’Cammon
of Charleston and two other passengers.</p>

<p>We crossed the Scioto at a ferry from the town, the stage
and four horses being all carried over in the boat.</p>

<p>The first two miles were over a rich bottom, subject to
inundation from the river floods in the winter. We had
then three miles of a hilly country to Congo, a fine settlement
in and round a beautiful prairie, a mile long to Crouse’s
mill. This Crouse is a wealthy man, having a good house
and offices, a farm of two sections, containing thirteen
hundred acres, and an excellent mill-house and mill wrought
by a creek which crosses the road and falls into the Scioto
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>half a mile on the left. Another mile brought us to Rickey’s
tavern, from whence a road leads to the left to Pickaway
Plains, which is a noble and rich prairie, on the west side
of the Scioto, fourteen miles long, formerly a principal settlement
of the Indians,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and {198} now well inhabited by
their white successors, who have a town called Levingston
on the Prairie.</p>

<p>From Rickey’s to M’Cutchin’s tavern is four miles,
across a beautiful savanna, variegated with clumps of trees,
and fine groves, with farms at every half mile. We here
stopped for a few minutes to water the horses, and I exchanged
my seat in the stage, with a Mr. Willis of Chilicothe,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
who had accompanied us on horseback, on his way
to the federal city, Washington, to make some arrangements
respecting the mails. The exchange suited us both, as on
horseback I had a better view of the country, and his health
being delicate, he preferred the stage.</p>

<p>The next six miles were through a thinly wooded but
rich plain, with a farm every mile, and a tavern every three
miles. The road was so far level but very miry, then another
mile and a half over some hilly and broken land brought
us to Lybrant’s tavern.</p>

<p>Had I not been informed, I should not have known that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>I was now in the town of Tarleton, as there was but one
other house besides the tavern; three or four more were
however just going to be built, and our landlord had no
doubt of its soon becoming a smart town. The lots were
sold at from sixteen to twenty-five dollars each.</p>

<p>Lybrant’s is one of the best and most reasonable inns I
had met with in my tour. At one o’clock we set down to a
most excellent breakfast of good coffee, roast fowls, chicken
pie, potatoes, bread and butter, and cucumbers both sliced
and pickled, all not only good, but delicate and fine even
to the pastry, which is very uncommon in this country, and
our charge was only a quarter of a dollar.</p>

<p>For eight miles from Tarleton, the road runs through
low, rich and miry black oak woods, and now and then a
small prairie, and settlements not {199} nearer each other
than every two miles. The country then rising into hills
the road improves, but it continues equally thinly inhabited,
the settlements being mostly on what is called the old county
road, which runs parallel to the state road about a mile and
a half to the northward of it, and is better and shorter by a
mile between Chilicothe and New Lancaster.</p>

<p>After riding a mile among the hills I passed Stukey’s
tavern, for six miles beyond which the face of the country
is very picturesque; the tops of the hills terminating in
rocks, some impending and some perpendicular, while the
road leads through a defile winding round their bottoms.
The whole country is covered with dwarf oak, and other low
shrubs and bushes and some thinly scattered black oaks of
stunted growth. This scarcity of timber is partly owing
to the poverty of the soil, and partly to the effect of fire,
which must have gone through this whole district of six or
seven miles, and that at no very distant period back, from
many evident marks still remaining. What a grand yet
awful scene must have been such a tract of woods in flames!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>
<p>There is no house for three miles from Stukey’s tavern,
and from that to within a mile of New Lancaster, there are
but two other settlements.—Then, on descending a low hill,
and emerging from the woods into an extensive natural
meadow on the western bank of the Hockhocking, that town
presents itself suddenly to view, well situated on a rising
ground on the opposite side of the river, and making a better
appearance at that distance than it has on entering it. A
wooden bridge crosses the river, which is here only a rivulet
just below the town, and here I passed a number of men
engaged in racing their horses.</p>

<p>New Lancaster<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> is a compact little town of one wide
street, about six hundred paces long, containing {200} sixty
houses, amongst which is a neat little court-house of brick,
forty-two by thirty-six feet, just built, with a cupola belfry.
There are six stores and nine taverns. There is but one
brick house, all the rest being of wood, amongst which conspicuously
the best is that of Mr. Bucher a lawyer. In
most towns in the United States, the best houses are chiefly
inhabited by gentlemen of that profession.</p>

<p>After supping at the inn where the stage stopped, I was
shewn to bed up stairs in a barrack room the whole extent
of the house, with several beds in it, one of which was already
occupied by a man and his wife, from the neighbouring
country, who both conversed with me until I feigned sleep,
in hopes that would silence them, but though they then
ceased to direct their discourse to me, they continued to talk
to each other on their most private and domestick affairs, as
though there had been no other person in the room. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>spite of their conversation I at last fell asleep, but I was
soon awoke in torture from a general attack made on me by
hosts of vermin of the most troublesome and disgusting
genii. I started from the bed, dressed myself, spread a
coverlet on the floor, and lay down there to court a little
more repose, but I was prevented by a constant noise in the
house during the whole night, beginning with church
musick, among which some sweet female voices were discernible,
and ending in the loud drunken frolicks of some
rustick guests, who kept Saturday night until late on Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>Previous to going to bed I had sauntered round the town,
and I observed all the taverns filled with guests in the roughest
style of conviviality, from which I infer that the last day
of the week is generally devoted to the orgies of Bacchus;
by the same classes of people who on the succeeding day,
attend with pious regularity the dogmatick lectures of some
fanatick dispenser of the gospel. What an heterogeneous
{201} animal is man!—sometimes exalted to an approach
towards divinity, sometimes debased to lower than brutality:—A
perpetual struggle between the essence and the dregs.</p>

<p>The dawn of morning relieved me from my uncomfortable
couch, and going down stairs, I found all as silent as an
hour before it had been noisy. I walked out into the town,
where the same stillness prevailed, so I lounged along the
banks of the Hockhocking enjoying the morning air, until a
thick mist rising with the sun envelopped me, when I returned
to the inn and finding the stage ready to depart, I
again mounted Mr. Willis’s horse, and set out in advance
of it.</p>

<p>Leaving New Lancaster and the fog below, I proceeded
eighteen miles through a hilly country, with settlements
within every mile, many of which were taverns. I then
stopped at Babb’s, the sign of the house, appropriate to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>being the half way house between Lancaster and Zanesville.
Here an old father, two sons and three daughters, (spruce,
well formed girls, with a most wonderful volubility of
tongue) worried me with questions, until I excused myself
from further gratifying their inexhaustible curiosity by
pleading fatigue, and throwing myself on a bed, I awaited
the arrival of the stage, about an hour, when we got an
excellent breakfast, every article of which served as a topick
for conversation to our garrulous entertainers, who affected
to know a little of every thing and of every body.</p>

<p>Nine miles from Babb’s, through a similar country and
very bad road with houses and taverns as in the morning,
brought me to Jonathan’s creek, a handsome little river,
about twenty yards wide, which I forded. The road was
now generally level seven miles to Springfield, mostly
through pleasant and rich little bottoms, with the creek close
on the right more than half the way, and the country so
thickly {202} inhabited, that was it not for the dead girdled<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
trees every where in the corn and wheat fields and meadows,
it would have the appearance of an old settlement.</p>

<p>About a mile from Springfield I passed through a fine
plain of a light sandy soil very proper for small grain, such
as wheat, rye and oats, which has been cleared previous to
this country being known to the whites. It is now covered
with dwarf oak, hazle, and other copse wood, and contains
probably fifteen hundred acres.</p>

<p>Springfield is a long straggling village, on a fine flat,
sheltered on the north by a small chain of low but abrupt
hills, and bounded on the south by the beautiful river Muskingum.
The road or street is of clean gravel, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>cabins are distinguished from those I had hitherto seen by
their chimneys of brick, instead of stone or logs. There
are some good brick houses building, and some taverns and
some stores, which give it a thriving appearance. There is
also a fine grist and saw mill at the falls of the Muskingum at
the upper end of the town. That river is about a hundred
yards wide at the ferry just below the falls, which are formed
by its being precipitated in a sheet, over a rock of about three
feet perpendicular depth, which extends quite across, and is
a fine object in the surrounding picturesque scenery. Another
good object is a cliff impending over the falls, which
terminates the chain of low hills behind Springfield.</p>

<p>I crossed the ferry to Zanesville, and dismounted at an
inn where the stage generally stops. On entering I walked
into a room, the door of which was open, where the first
object that met my eye was the {203} corpse of a female, laid
out in her shroud on a bier. There was no person in the
room but another female who was seated near the corpse,
and to whom I apologized for my abrupt entrance, explaining
my reasons as being in advance of the stage. She answered
by wishing she had some mode of preventing the
stage from driving up to the house, as her sister had died
that morning, and it would be inconvenient to accommodate
travellers that night, on which I remounted, rode to
the post office, where I found the stage delivering the mail,
from whence in consequence of my information, the driver
took us to Harvey’s very good inn, where we found an
excellent supper, clean beds, a consequential host and
hostess, and the highest charges I had hitherto paid in
Ohio.</p>

<p>Zanesville was laid out for a town six or seven years ago.
It contains forty houses much scattered and does not seem
to thrive so much as Springfield, which is only two or three
years old, contains fifty houses, and bids fair to become of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>more consequence than Zanesville,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> notwithstanding the
latter is the county town of Muskingum county. It was
named after Mr. Zane of Wheeling, who as a recompense for
opening the first road from Wheeling to Chilicothe, got a
grant of three sections of land of six hundred and forty
acres each. On one section he founded Zanesville; on
another, New Lancaster, and the third is part of the rich
bottom on the bank of the Scioto opposite to Chilicothe.</p>

<p>On Monday 17th August, I proceeded from Zanesville
before breakfast. The first nine miles were through a hilly
country with houses every mile or two, the road tolerably
good except in a few steep or miry spots. I then passed
Brown’s tavern, most romantically situated in a deep and
narrow valley, with Salt creek, a rivulet which I crossed,
running through it. Two genteel looking travellers were
at Brown’s door as I passed. It was about breakfast time.
My appetite tempted me to stop and join them, but reflecting
the stage would then get before me, I repressed it, and trotted
on towards the usual place of breakfast of the stage.</p>

<p>From Salt creek, I ascended half a mile of a steep road
to the highest hill which I had been yet on in this state, and
keeping two miles along its ridge, I had there to ascend a
still higher pinnacle of it, from whence there is a most extensive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>view in every direction, of ridges beyond ridges
covered with forests, to the most distant horizon; but though
grand and extensive, it is dreary and cheerless, excepting
to a mind which anticipates the great change which the
astonishingly rapid settlement of this country will cause in
the face of nature in a few revolving years. Such a mind
will direct the eye ideally to the sides of hills covered with
the most luxuriant gifts of Ceres; to valleys divested of their
trees, and instead of the sombre forest, strengthening the
vision with their verdant herbage, while the rivers and brooks,
no {205} longer concealed by woods, meander through them
in every direction in silvered curves, resplendent with the
rays of a glowing sun, darting through an unclouded atmosphere;
while the frequent comfortable and tasty farm
house—the mills—the villages, and the towns marked
by their smoke and distant spires, will cause the traveller
to ask himself with astonishment, “So short a time since,
could this have been an uninhabited wilderness?”</p>

<p>This lofty ridge continues with various elevations five
miles and a half farther to Ensloe’s tavern, and is well inhabited
all the way, and well timbered, though the soil is
rather light. I here stopped to await the stage and breakfast,
after which I rode on through a hilly country, rather
thinly inhabited, five miles, and then three more on a flat,
of the most wretched road imaginable, from the frequency of
sloughs of stiff mud and clay. Travellers have ironically
nicknamed this part of the road Will’s creek plains. It is
really almost impassable for even the strong stage wagons
which are used here.</p>

<p>After getting safely through the plains, and a mile further
over a ridge, I came to Will’s creek, which is a small muddy
river with a very slow current. The banks are steep and
the bottom muddy, so that it has to be crossed by a wooden
bridge, which has become extremely dangerous, from some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>of the posts having been unplaced by floods, so that it is
shelving, one side being a good deal higher than the other,
and the balustrade is so much decayed that it would not
support a man, much less a carriage, yet bad as it was, I
had to pay a toll of an eighth of a dollar for my horse.
Though the European drivers far exceed the American in
dexterity and speed, on their fine roads, in this country
they would be good for nothing, and would pronounce it
impossible to get a carriage through roads, that the American
driver dashes through without a thought.—So much
for habit.</p>

<p>{206} On crossing the bridge, I was astonished to find
myself in a town of cabins in the midst of a forest, which
I had heard nothing of before. It is called Cambridge,
and was laid out last year by Messrs. Gumbar and Beattie
the proprietors, the first of whom resides in it. The lots
sell at from thirty to thirty-five dollars each. There are now
twelve cabins finished and finishing, each of which contains
two or three families; about as many more and some good
houses, are to be commenced immediately. The settlement
being very sudden, there was not as yet house room, for the
furniture, utensils, and goods of the settlers, those articles
were therefore lying out promiscuously about the cabins.
The settlers are chiefly from the island of Guernsey, near
the coast of France, from whence eight families arrived only
four months ago.</p>

<p>I think Cambridge bids fair to become the capital of a
county very soon.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The lands in the neighbourhood are
equal in richness of soil to any I have seen on this side of
Paint creek bottoms near Chilicothe.</p>

<p>Four miles from hence through a hilly country, brought
me to Beymer’s tavern, passing a drove of one hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>and thirty cows and oxen, which one Johnston was driving
from the neighbourhood of Lexington in Kentucky, to
Baltimore. The intercourse between the most distant
parts of the United States is now so common, that imported
merchandize is wagonned all the way to Chilicothe and the
intermediate towns, from Philadelphia and Baltimore,
nearly six hundred miles, and then retailed as cheaply as at
the ports of entry.</p>

<p>The drover with six assistants, two horsemen, two family
wagons, and the stage wagon, put up at Beymer’s for the
night, so that the house which was only a double cabin,
was well filled, though not so much crowded as might have
been expected, as the cattle drivers made a fire and encamped
without doors, convenient to where they had penned the
cattle, and {207} one of the travelling families slept in their
wagon.—This family consisted of a man and his wife, and a
neighbour’s daughter, who had removed to this state last
year, from near Washington in Pennsylvania, and were now
returning two hundred miles for some effects they had left
behind. The other family, named Hutchinson, had emigrated
from Massachusetts to Franklinville in this state,
four years ago. By clearing and cultivating a farm and
keeping a store, a distillery, and a saw mill, and then selling
their property at its increased value, they had in that short
time acquired a sufficiency to think themselves independent,
and were now returning, to settle in some place in the neighbourhood
of Albany, in the state of New York, where the
old man said, “he would be once more in the world.” The
systematick order which this family observed in travelling,
and the comparative ease and comfort they enjoyed in
consequence, were circumstances noticed by me with much
admiration. The family consisted of Hutchinson and his
wife, two daughters from fifteen to seventeen years of age,
a grown up son they called doctor, another son about ten,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>and a young man who had had the charge of the mill, and
who still continued with the family. They had a wagon,
with four horses, and a saddle horse rode by one of the girls.
On their stopping, the daughters began directly to prepare
supper, as though they were at home, baked bread enough to
serve them that night and next day, and then they sat down
to sewing as composedly, as if they had been in their own
house, and not on a journey; while the boys took care of the
horses, and the old couple, though still active and healthy,
sat at their ease, chatting and enjoying themselves. At all
events <i>they</i> were reaping the benefit of having brought up
their family in orderly and industrious habits, and the
cheerfulness and hilarity which pervaded each individual,
was a proof that they were all equally {208} sensible of the
blessings which their own good conduct had put them in the
enjoyment of.</p>

<p>I had a good supper and bed, and found Beymer’s double
cabin a most excellent house of accommodation. He is one
of the proprietors of the stage wagons, and owns very considerable
property in the state.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 18th August, the stage being only to go
fifteen miles, and the same distance next day, on account of
the arrangement of the carriage of the mails, rather than
travel such a snail’s pace, I proceeded on foot, leaving my
baggage to follow in the stage. The first five miles were
excellent road, over a long but not very high ridge of hills,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>without a single house to Washington, or Beymerstown, as
it is more generally called, from its being owned by the
family of Beymer, two of whom keep taverns in it.—It has
twelve cabins, four of which are taverns, and a blacksmith’s
shop.</p>

<p>Four and a half miles further have no inhabitants; the
road is still good, but is led over several high, short and steep
ridges, which generally run from north to south. Then
passing a cabin and farm, in half a mile more I came to
Frankfort or Smithstown, where I breakfasted. This is a
small village or rather hamlet of eight or ten houses and
cabins, some of which, as well as several in the neighbourhood,
are inhabited by families from Peeks-hill in New
York, many of whom regret their having removed {209} from
thence to this place, and with great reason, if one may
judge from the appearance of the soil, which is all a red
and yellow clay, very stiff, and apparently very unproductive.</p>

<p>The country now became better settled, but still continued
very hilly. I walked on, passing Wherry’s tavern where the
stage was to sleep at five miles, and stopping at Bradshaw’s,
where I rested about half an hour, and got some refreshment.
This family is from the county Monaghan in Ireland.
Their house is too small for an inn, but they have a good
farm. Ten miles further brought me to Morristown,
through a similar hilly country, with a succession of woods
and farms, the latter at every mile, and a tavern at every
two miles.</p>

<p>On the road I met in straggling parties above fifty horsemen
with rifles, who had been in Morristown at a militia
muster, for the purpose of volunteering, or of being drafted
to serve against Britain, in case of a war with that country,
now much talked of. Most of them were above half seas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>over, and they travelled with much noise—some singing,
some swearing, some quarrelling, some laughing, according
to their different natural dispositions, which are always
most manifest when in that unguarded situation.</p>

<p>I found Morristown, where I arrived just before dark, all
in a bustle from the same cause, many of the country people
remaining to a late hour, drinking and fighting.</p>

<p>My host Morrison who is a justice of the peace, and a
major of the militia, had shut his house against them, but
there was another tavern, where squire Morrison, while commanding
the peace, during an affray, came in for his share
of the blows, and had his shirt torn.</p>

<p>I got a very good supper—bathed my feet and went to
bed in a room where a man and his wife, a young married
couple, in another bed, acted over a {210} similar scene to
what I had experienced at New Lancaster, keeping me
awake chatting to me until a very late hour.</p>

<p>After a short but sound sleep, I awoke at an early hour
well refreshed, and pushed on eleven miles to St. Clairsville,
through a fine, well improved, and well inhabited country,
which was still hilly, but the ridges were neither so steep
nor so high, as they are in general at this side of Chilicothe.</p>

<p>I stopped at Thompson’s stage inn, where Mrs. Thompson
who was very civil, prepared me a good breakfast.</p>

<p>St. Clairsville, or Newelstown, as it is more frequently
improperly called, is the capital of Belmont county, and is
pleasantly situated on the point and top of the highest hill
within sight, from whence twelve or fourteen miles of ridges
and woods may be seen in every direction, some of them
across the Ohio, which I was now again approaching. The
town is only about four years old, and already contains eighty
good houses, including several stores and taverns. It has a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>court-house and gaol, and altogether it has the greatest
appearance of wealth and business of any town between
Chilicothe and itself. There are several Quakers, settled
in the neighbourhood, who are a snug, wealthy and industrious
people, and who enhance the value of real property
in a wide extent around the focus of their settlements.</p>

<p>Leaving St. Clairsville at eleven o’clock, I joined a footman
named Musgrave, who was going to Morgantown in
Virginia, to collect money to pay off some incumbrances on
his lands below Limestone. He was a plain man, but an
intelligent, expeditious and economical traveller, whose
company shortened the road to Wheeling. It is a well settled
country and a fine road, the first six miles from St.
Clairsville. We then descended a long hill into the river
bottom of Indian Wheeling, where we came to a good grist
{211} and saw mill. Keeping down that fine little mill
river five miles to its confluence with the Ohio, we forded it
five times in that distance.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Ohio is a new town called Canton,
laid out by Mr. Zane last year, which has now thirteen
houses. We here crossed a ferry of a quarter of a mile to
Zane’s island, which we walked across, upwards of half a
mile, through a fertile, extensive, and well cultivated farm,
the property of Mr. Zane, some of whose apples, pulled from
the orchard in passing, were very refreshing to us, while we
sat on the bank nearly an hour awaiting the ferry boat.
At last the boat came, and we crossed the second ferry of
another quarter of a mile to Wheeling.</p>

<p>Here my fellow traveller took leave of me, purposing to
go five or six miles further ere night, though it was now five
o’clock, and we had already walked upwards of thirty miles
since morning.</p>

<p>I stopped at Knox’s inn, where I asked for some beer,
not daring to drink wine or spirits. They had none, so I
walked out to a small house where I had observed on a
sign <i>Beer and Cakes</i>. On entering {212} I found Musgrave
making a hearty meal on a cent roll and a pint of beer. He
appeared as glad to see me again as if we had been old
acquaintances, and had been long parted, and was easily
prevailed on to make a second libation with me to the prosperous
termination of our journies, in that humble, but
wholesome and refreshing beverage. I then returned to
Knox’s, where I supped and slept. Next morning at dawn,
I took a plunge in the river, and after breakfast, finding my
strength invigorated and my spirits renovated by the cold
bath, I continued my journey on foot by the most direct
road to Washington, instead of awaiting for the stage according
to my first intention, as it had to go ten miles out of
the direct road to deliver the mail at Charlestown.</p>

<p>I set out at half past nine o’clock, and soon gained the
top of the hill immediately over Wheeling, from whence
there is a handsome bird’s eye view of that town, Zane’s
island in fine cultivation, the two ferries across the Ohio,
and the village of Canton beyond; while on the left the Ohio
is seen winding among hills five or six miles below, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>view is bounded in that direction, by one ridge rising beyond
another to a great distance. Turning round on the narrow
ridge over which the road leads, I had Wheeling creek
directly under me at the foot of a precipice, it running in such
a manner as to make the scite of the town with the hill
behind, almost a peninsula, between it and the Ohio.</p>

<p>I had proceeded about a mile, when meeting a traveller,
of whom I inquired, I found I had taken a wrong road, in
consequence of which I had to descend a steep precipice
on my right, letting myself down with my hands from one
tree to another, to the bottom. Here I got into the right
road, which follows the meanders of the creek up a fine
valley that has been settled about thirty years, and is now in a
state of excellent cultivation.</p>

<p>{213} At two miles from Wheeling I passed a very handsome
house, a fine farm, and a mill of a Mr. Woods on the
left. Here I could not help being struck with the difference
of appearance between this wooden house painted white,
with green jalousie window shutters and red roof, and the
stone and brick houses of Ohio and Kentucky, much in
favour of the former, however better in reality the latter may
be. A mile farther I passed Mr. Chaplin’s fine merchant
mill, and about a mile and a half beyond that, where the
valley narrows, I observed on the left, some very remarkable
large loose rocks, which seem to have fallen from a rocky
cliff which impends above.</p>

<p>Half a mile beyond this, I stopped at a Mr. Eoff’s neat
cottage and good farm, where every thing had an air of
plenty and comfort. Four or five genteel looking young
women were all engaged in sedentary domestick avocations,
and an old lady served me with some milk and water which
I had requested, after which I resumed my walk.</p>

<p>A mile up the side of the creek brought me to Mr. Shepherd’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>mill, and elegant house of cut stone.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Here the
creek forks and the road also, one of the forks called Big
Wheeling coming from the S. E. and the right hand road
leading along it to Morgantown; the left fork called Little
Wheeling, which forms Mr. Shepherd’s mill race, coming
from the eastward, and my road towards Washington leading
along it, through a narrow valley with small farms,
wherever a bottom or an easy declivity of the hills would
permit.</p>

<p>I was here overtaken by a man on horseback, who very
courteously insisted on my riding his horse, while he walked
above a mile. He was a county Tyrone man in the north
of Ireland, settled twelve years in America, the last six of
which has been in this neighbourhood, where he cultivated
a farm with good success. Indeed industry and sobriety is
all {214} that is necessary in any part of the United States, to
the westward of the mountains, to insure a comfortable
independence in a very few years.</p>

<p>My companion stopping at a house on the road, I again
proceeded alone to M’Kinley’s tavern, four miles from
Shepherd’s. I here left the creek on the left, crossing a
smaller one which falls into it from the right, and I then
ascended a steep and high hill, called Roney’s point, from
its being the point of a ridge, and first owned by one Roney.
It was above half a mile to the top of hill, from whence a
fine, thickly settled and well cultivated, but very hilly
country broke on my view, beautifully variegated with
cornfields in tassel—wheat and oat stubble—meadows—orchards—cottages—and
stacks of grain and hay innumerable,
with a small coppice of wood between every plantation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Descending a little, a mile and a half further brought me
to William Trusdale’s cottage, where I rested, and refreshed
with some buttermilk and water, and then went on through
the same kind of country, four miles from Trusdale’s, to
the Virginia and Pennsylvania boundary line, half a mile
beyond which I entered the village of Alexandria. A gust
approaching fast I stopped about half an hour at John
Woodburn’s tavern. This village is named from a Mr.
Alexander, the proprietor of the soil, and is nicknamed
Hardscramble, either from the hilly roads by which one
arrives at it, or from the difficulty experienced by the first
settlers to obtain a subsistence. It contains about a dozen
houses and cabins, a meeting house, and three taverns, but
it does not seem to thrive.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>After the gust I proceeded six miles through a very fine
country, charmingly variegated, but hilly, to M’Crackan’s
tavern. The rain had rendered the road so slippery, that
I could travel but slowly, so that it was almost dark when I
arrived there.</p>

<p>{215} I found another traveller in the house, who was
going from the western part of Massachusetts near Albany,
to the western part of Virginia, as an agent to dispose of
some large tracts of land there, owned by some people in
Albany. Having got some thickened milk for supper, and
bathed my feet in cold water, I had a fine night’s rest.</p>

<p>I would not mention so often my mode of living and
treating myself while on this journey, only to shew the good
effects of temperance and cleanliness, which enabled me,
though in so warm a season, to travel either on foot or on
horseback, without fatigue or injury to my constitution.</p>

<p>Thursday, twenty-first August, I walked on with the
first dawn of a fine morning, nothing being wanting
to render it delightful, except the carrol of the winged
inhabitants of the woods, which throughout this whole
country is very rare. I stopped to rest a few minutes at
Clement’s tavern, five miles on the road, where I found a
number of young men and women up, and drest decently,
and even genteelly, though so early; indeed many of them
had the appearance of not having been in bed all night.
On inquiry I learned that there had been a wedding here
last night, which had occasioned such a concourse of young
people. Several of the males joined {216} the landlord in
civilly pressing me to take my morning dram of bitters with
them, and they were not a little astonished at my excusing
myself, and requesting in lieu, a little milk and water.</p>

<p>Wishing to arrive in Washington in time to join the stage
for Pittsburgh, I walked very fast, on a good road, through
a pleasant but hilly country, and got to M’Cammont’s
tavern, as the family were rising from breakfast.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The
table was however soon replenished with plenty and variety,
to which I did ample justice from the excellent effect on
my appetite, of early rising, and a ten miles’ walk.</p>

<p>Having a little time before the stage would depart, I
walked through the town, and was much pleased with it.
Washington is surrounded by a fertile, well cultivated, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>well inhabited country, rather hilly, but the hills not very
steep. The town occupies a hill itself, and consists of one
main street, intersected at right angles by four shorter ones,
the whole containing one hundred and seventy-five dwelling
houses, a good brick court-house and a stone gaol adjoining;
two meeting houses, one of brick for Presbyterians, and an
old one of logs for Methodists; a neat masonick lodge of
stone and lime, and a small market house. There are several
stores and taverns, and on the whole it is a thriving town,
and a pleasant residence for either trader, mechanick or
private man, the inhabitants being a spirited and polished
people, mostly descendants from the northern Irish.</p>

<p>At noon I left Washington in the stage, having the pleasure
of a fellow traveller in my old acquaintance Dearborn,
who was returning to Pittsburgh after an excursion to Washington
for the purpose of taking some likenesses. His
anecdotes of domestick and social occurrences at Pittsburgh
during my absence, beguiled the time pleasantly, and we
were in Canonsburgh, without being sensible of the seven
{217} miles between Washington and it. The road leads
mostly along Chartier’s creek, crossing it three times in that
distance. We stopped at Westbay’s excellent tavern, where
is also the post office. They were making preparations for
dinner, which (having breakfasted so late) we declined
partaking of, and amused ourselves with a walk through
the town. It is on the S. western declivity of a steep hill,
having Chartier’s creek at the bottom. It contains eighty-eight
houses, of different descriptions, exclusive of the college,
which is a plain stone edifice, much out of repair, with a
cupola belfry. There is also a small market house, but
the town does not seem flourishing; indeed was it not for the
college, it would probably soon go to decay, in favour of its
more successful neighbour Washington.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The most striking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>thing I saw here was my landlord’s garden, which is both
good and handsome, being laid out with taste, abounding in
a variety of the best culinary vegetables, and having some
very pleasant shady bowers, where the student, or man of
leisure, sheltered from the noonday sun, and inhaling the
fragrance of the surrounding aromatick plants, might
luxuriantly roam into the realms of fancy.</p>

<p>Two miles from Canonsburgh, we passed Morganza, the
seat of general Morgan, on the left. It is a long and narrow
frame building, with two ends lower than the body of the
house, by way of wings—the whole ornamented with green
jalousie window shutters. The situation, immediately on
the road side, does not appear well chosen, especially as the
general apparently had a choice of a variety of situations,
any of which I should have supposed, would have merited
a preference. One is more apt to be struck with any thing
like false taste in any work which has been finished under
the direction of a man of education and refinement, which in
addition to {218} liberal hospitality, is general Morgan’s
character, as well as that of his amiable and accomplished
lady.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>At Fosset’s, three miles further, we changed an excellent
set of grey horses, for as good a one of bays, owned by my
friend M’Cullough of Pittsburgh.—For four miles from
Fosset’s to M’Cully’s, the country is neither so fertile, nor so
well cultivated as before, but it there improves again a little,
and is ornamented at two miles further, by colonel Plummer’s
fanciful but handsome house and fine farm on the left.
Rather exceeding three miles more brought us to the top of
the Coal hill, the descent of which to the Monongahela,
almost a mile, is so steep that two of the wheels of the stage
wagon had to be locked, and I frequently wished myself
out of it, but it was impossible to stop to get out, so I comforted
myself with the reflection that no unfortunate accident
had yet happened to the stages on this hill, which giving
me courage, I was enabled to enjoy the views so inexpressibly
fine, which are perpetually varying, as the road winds
down the hill.</p>

<p>From a bird’s eye view on the top, the town of Pittsburgh,
Grant’s hill, and even Boyd’s hill so much higher than
Grant’s, appear as a plain, enclosed by the Monongahela
from the S. E. directly under one, and the Allegheny meeting
it at a point below the town, and both together forming
the Ohio, which glides off majestically towards the N. W.—keeping
the course of the Monongahela rather than that of
the more rapid Allegheny, which flowing into it at a right
angle from the N. E. is seen several miles upwards in that
direction, with some beautiful islands about three miles
above Pittsburgh. Descending the hill, the Monongahela
gradually opens more on the right from its breadth assuming
the appearance of a beautiful lake surrounded by irregular
hills, with Mr. Beelen’s finely situated country house, shewing
to great advantage, at its upper end.</p>

<p>{219} When near the bottom of the coal hill, a sudden
precipice on the right, and a short turn of the road to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>left, brought back our thoughts home to ourselves, but the
well trained horses seeming to know exactly where they
should place their feet, soon removed us from the object
of terror, and without stopping, trotted directly with the
stage and us into the ferry flat, which was prepared to receive
us—after which, ten minutes sufficed to land us at
Pittsburgh.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="label">[153]</a> Morganza was the home of Colonel George Morgan, a prominent character
in Western land history. He was originally a member of a large firm of Philadelphia
Indian traders, and made journeys to Pittsburg as early as 1768. In the treaty
of Fort Stanwix of that year, his firm was one of those reimbursed for losses by a
grant of Western lands, out of which grew the Indiana Company, for which Morgan
during many years acted as agent and secretary, vainly seeking confirmation of the
grant by the Virginia legislature and later by Congress. At the outbreak of the
Revolution, Morgan was made Indian agent for the Western Department, with
headquarters at Pittsburg. At the close of the war, removal to Princeton, New
Jersey, brought Morgan into contact with college life, his services as trustee being
much appreciated. In 1788-89, he was engaged in a scheme for settling a colony
on Spanish territory at New Madrid, but several trips to New Orleans on this
business failed to effect a satisfactory arrangement. Morgan next turned his
attention to the estate in Washington County, Pennsylvania, which had recently
been bequeathed to him by his brother. Thither he removed in 1796, and at
Morganza occurred the dinner at which Burr was charged with treasonable remarks
against the authority of the United States. The death of Morgan occurred
at Morganza in 1810.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>At the conflux of the rivers Allegheny and Monongahela,
the French when possessed of Canada, had the principal of
a line of posts extending from that country round the back
frontier of the British settlements, for the purposes of awing
the aborigines and commanding their trade, and to prevent
the spreading of the Anglo-American colonization beyond
these limits. It was named Fort Du Quesne, after the
Marquis Du Quesne, a governour of Canada. It was always
kept well garrisoned by European troops, and in time of war,
was never without an army of auxiliary Indians encamped
under its protection. This continual state of preparation cost
the British much blood. In the year 1757, general Grant,
with a regiment of eight hundred Scotch highlanders,
arrived without discovery on a hill immediately commanding
the fort, since named after him Grant’s hill, where thinking
himself secure of conquest, he alarmed the enemy by
beating the reveille at sunrise. The garrison, without
awaiting {220} to be attacked in the fort, which would not
have been tenable, and reinforced by a strong body of Indians,
stole out under the high river banks, and divided itself into
two parties, one of which took the route upwards of the
Monongahela, and the other that of the Allegheny, until
they flanked Grant’s little army, when profiting by the
woods, with which the hill and surrounding country were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>then covered, they suddenly attacked it in flanks and rear,
cut to pieces, tomahawked and scalped the greater number,
while the rest with the general saved their lives by becoming
prisoners to the French, on whose mercy they threw themselves.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The following year 1758, was productive of greater
slaughter to the British, by the defeat of general Braddock’s
army of five thousand men, being surprised by the French
and Indians in great force on the banks of the Monongahela,
when within eight miles of Fort Du Quesne, then a wilderness,
but now well inhabited and ornamented on the very
spot by the handsome brick house and fine farm of judge
Wallace.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The general and three-fourths of the army,
were shot down from behind trees, while in the parade of
European tacticks, presenting four bold open fronts to the
enemy, being formed in a hollow square. The few who
escaped, did so under the protection of Col. since Gen.
Washington’s provincial militia, who by opposing a similar
warfare against the savage enemy, covered the retreat of the
few remaining regulars.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards in the same year, the fort capitulated
to general Forbes, and the river Allegheny having made
some encroachment on it by undermining its banks, a new
and more extensive fortification of a square with four bastions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>was erected by general Stanwix just above, and named
Fort Pitt, in honour of the then prime minister of England.—It
cost government £60,000 sterling. A garrison {221} was
kept here for several years after the peace of 1763, but it
was withdrawn on the commencement of the disputes
between Britain and America, and the inhabitants of the surrounding
settlement, which had not yet taken the form of a
town, occasionally forted themselves for defence against the
Indians, and so late as the year 1781, there were only a few
small houses and cabins on the banks of the two rivers,
under protection of the fort, a noble row of brick and stone
houses built by the French Indian traders on the banks of
the Allegheny, having been undermined and swept away
by that river since 1766, in the memory of some of the present
inhabitants of Pittsburgh.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> After 1781, Pittsburgh
began to improve slowly, and in 1784 a gazette<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> was established
in it.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In 1783 Fort Pitt was repaired by general
Irwin, but was afterwards neglected, and a stoccado fort
called Fort Fayette, was erected on the bank of the Allegheny,
half a mile above Fort Pitt.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Fort Fayette is now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>used as a barrack and place of deposit of stores, but is useless
for either offence or defence. The surrounding grounds
were handsomely laid out, planted, and ornamented by
general Wilkinson<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> some years ago, and considering the
smallness of the field he had to work on, shew much taste,
and are an ornament to the eastern and principal approach
to the town, in which situation the fort stands.</p>

<p>The town or borough, as it now is, has increased in a very
rapid degree both in size and consequence since the last
ten years. The plan, by its being designed to suit both
rivers, is rather irregular, Penn and Liberty streets which
are very fine streets, running parallel to the Allegheny,
while the principal {222} part of the town is parallel and at
right angles with the Monongahela.</p>

<p>In seventeen streets and four lanes or alleys in March
1808, were two hundred and thirty-six brick houses, of
which forty-seven were built in the last twelve months, and
three hundred and sixty-one wooden ones, seventy of which
were added last year. There are fifty stores generally well
assorted and supplied, and which divide the retail business
of the town and adjacent country in tolerably good proportion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>Some however have rather a superiority of custom,
the owner of one of which, a man of veracity, assured me
that he received in ready money, one market day with
another, one hundred and fifty dollars, and that he had once
taken one hundred and eighty besides the credit business.
Either as a trading or a manufacturing town, I think Pittsburgh
for situation, is not excelled in the United States, and
that it bids fair to become the emporium of the centre of the
federal union. There are 24 taverns, four or five of which
are excellent ones, and the rest of every grade. An account
of the manufacturies and tradesmen was taken in the fall
of 1807, the result of which was—A cotton manufactury,
having a mule of 120 threads, a spinning jenny of 40 threads,
4 looms and a wool carding machine under the same roof; a
glasswork for green glass on the opposite side of the Monongahela,
and another just erected for white glass on the town
side of the same river; two breweries, where are made excellent
beer and porter, equal to any in the United States; an air
furnace, where all sorts of hollow iron utensils are cast;
four nail facturies, at one of which one hundred tons of cut
and hammered nails are made annually; seven coppersmiths,
tinplate workers and japanners; one wire weaving and riddle
factury; one brass foundery; six saddlers and harness-makers;
two gun-smiths; two tobacconists; one bell-maker; three
tallow-chandlers; {223} one brush maker; one trunk-maker;
five coopers; thirteen weavers; ten blue-dyers; one comb-maker;
seven cabinet-makers; one turner in brass, ivory and
wood; six bakers; eight butchers; two barbers; six hatters;
two potteries of earthen ware; eight straw bonnet-makers;
four plane-makers; six milliners; twelve mantua-makers; one
stocking weaver; two book-binders; four house and sign painters;
two portrait painters; one mattress-maker; three wheelwrights;
five watch and clock-makers and silversmiths; five
bricklayers, five plasterers; three stonecutters; eight boat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>barge and ship builders; one pump-maker; one looking-glass
plater and maker; one lock-maker; seven tanners; two rope-makers;
one spinning wheel maker; seventeen blacksmiths;
one machinist and whitesmith; one cutler and tool-maker;
thirty-two house carpenters and joiners; twenty-one boot
and shoemakers; five windsor chair-makers; thirteen tailors;
one breeches-maker and skin-dresser; twelve school-masters;
four schoolmistresses; four printing offices; six brick yards;
three stone masons; two book-stores; four lumber yards; one
maker of machinery for cotton and woolen manufacturies;
one factury for clay smoking-pipes; and one copper-plate
printing press.</p>

<p>The tradesmen above mentioned are all master-workmen,
who employ more or less assistants in proportion to their
business.</p>

<p>Besides the fine situation of Pittsburgh for manufacturies,
another circumstance encourages much the settlement of
industrious tradesmen in it, which is the cheap, plentiful
and various market. There are two market days weekly,
and the common prices of necessaries are,—good beef, from
2½ to 4 cents per lb., pork 3½, mutton 4, veal 3, venison 3 to
4, bacon 6 to 10, butter 10 to 18, cheese 8 to 12, hogs lard 8,
{224} fowls each 10 to 12, ducks 25, geese 33 to 37, turkies
40 to 75, flour $1 75 to 2 50 per cwt. or from 3 50 to 4 50 per
barrel, corn 33, potatoes 40, turnips 18, Indian meal 40
cents per bushel, onions a dollar, white beans a dollar, dried
apples and peaches a dollar, and green 40 cents per bushel,
eggs 10 to 18 cents per dozen, fresh fish 3 to 6 cents per lb.,
maple sugar, very good, made in the country, 10 to 12 cents
a pound, whiskey 30 to 40 cents per gallon, peach brandy 75
to 80, beer 5 to 7 dollars a barrel, and cider 3 to 4, 700
country linen 40 cents, and tow cloth 33 cents per yard;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
but salt comes high, being generally 2½ dollars per bushel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>which is occasioned by its being supplied from the Onondago
salt works, in the upper part of the state of New York,
from whence it is brought by water with a few portages,
through part of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and down
French creek and the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, where it is a
great article of trade, giving employment to several keel boats
on the river.</p>

<p>The situation of Pittsburgh is unrivalled with respect
to water communication, with a great extent and variety
of country; and would also be so in beauty was it not hemmed
in too closely by high and steep hills. It may notwithstanding
be called a beautiful situation, as there is a variety
in those very hills, which all differ in appearance from each
other, and admit between them fine vistas up the Allegheny
and Monongahela, and down the Ohio, which river is
formed by the confluence of the other two, and which after
flowing eleven hundred miles through all its sinuosities, is
itself lost in the Mississippi, at a point about W. S. W. from
Pittsburgh, from whence eleven hundred miles more carry
that chief of Atlantick rivers (whether with regard to unimpeded
navigation, or the immense body of water discharged
through it) into the ocean below New Orleans, in {225} about
a south direction from its confluence with the Ohio.</p>

<p>Standing on the point which was the scite of the old
French Fort Du Quesne, about the middle of the last century,
and of which there is now no vestige, and looking up
the Allegheny to the northward, a chain of hills, with a narrow
bottom partially cultivated between the hills and the
river, bound the view on the left, while two beautiful little
islands, the uppermost one cultivated, and owned by a Mr.
Wainwright from England, terminate the water prospect
in front.</p>

<p>Turning gradually to the right, the eye looks over the dry
ditch and old ramparts of the former English Fort Pitt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>which succeeded Fort Du Quesne, beyond which are a few
straggling apple and pear trees, being all that remains of the
king’s and artillery gardens, planted and cultivated by the
first British garrison, and now laid out in streets and town
lots. Looking onward up the bank of the river, which is
about thirty feet above the surface, when the water is lowest,
houses, trees, and cultivated fields, are seen for three miles
to Mr. Davis’s large, and handsomely situated house, about
half a mile beyond the race course, and the same distance
above Wainwright’s island. Hills covered with wood, rising
amphitheatre-like behind Davis’s, terminate the view that
way.</p>

<p>Turning a little more to the right, the eye follows the
Quarry hill, which is a ridge of from two hundred and
fifty to three hundred feet perpendicular height, crowned
with lofty forest trees, under which is a quarry of fine
building stone, about half a mile long, with a good wagon
road along its whole length, from every part of which are
most charming views of the town and rivers, the cultivated
sides of the hill below, and the rich and luxuriant plain of a
quarter of a mile wide between the foot of the hill and the
Allegheny, {226} with the post and stage road from Philadelphia
and the eastern states running through the middle of
it two miles from Hill’s tavern to the town, which in its
most compact part, with the belfry of the court-house, the
Episcopal brick octagonal church, a handsome Presbyterian
brick meeting house, and the roofs of the dwelling houses
intermixed with lombardy poplars and weeping willows,
the eye still approaching itself, is the next object.</p>

<p>A little to the right of the last line of view, Grant’s hill,
with its sloping sides and regular ascent to about one hundred
feet perpendicular height, covered with delightful short green
herbage, seems to obtrude itself into the town, affording to
the citizens a charming mall or promenade both for exercise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>and air. It lies within the bounds of the borough; but
it is to be hoped that general O’Hara, who is the proprietor,
will with true patriotism, reserve it for its present use, and
not permit one of the greatest ornaments of Pittsburgh to
be destroyed, by having it cut down and levelled for building
lots. Its belonging to a man of such extensive property is a
fortunate circumstance for the inhabitants, as that may prevent
its being changed from pleasure to profit, to which it
might be more liable was it owned by some needy person.
Was the general to fence it in, terrace it, which could be
done at a small expense, ornament it with clumps of evergreens
and flowering shrubs, and erect a few banqueting
houses in the forms of small temples according to the different
orders of architecture, it would be one of the most beautiful
spots, which not only America but perhaps any town
in the universe could boast of.</p>

<p>Grant’s hill is united to the Quarry hill, by a plain at
first flat, then rising gradually, over the middle of which on a
very commanding situation, is seen the handsome cottage
of Mr. Tannehill, a continental officer during the revolutionary
war, who now enjoys {227} the evening of life in the
shade of the finest fruit trees of this climate, of his own
planting, for which rational and delightful employment as
well as horticulture in general, he has a good taste.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Still continuing to turn to the right, the next prominent
object is the house of Mr. James Ross, an eminent lawyer,
which he purchased from a Mons. Marie, a Frenchman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>who had taken great pains to cultivate a good garden, which
Mr. Ross does not neglect, and in which, on the top of an
ancient Indian tumulus or barrow, is a handsome octangular
summer house of lattice work, painted white, which forms a
conspicuous and pleasing object.</p>

<p>From Mr. Ross’s, which is immediately behind the top
of Grant’s hill, there is a gradual slope to a small but elevated
plain, called Scotch or Scots hill, from its being the
residence of several families from the northern Hebrides.
It is improperly called a hill as it is no higher than the general
level of the town, which is about forty feet above the low
water mark of the Monongahela, to the bank of which
river this plain extends, from the foot of the hill below Mr.
Ross’s house.</p>

<p>A valley commencing at the upper extremity of this plain,
divides Grant’s and Grove hills (the latter the seat of Mr.
Tannehill before mentioned) from Boyd’s hill, which equally
steep and twice as high as Grant’s, is the most striking
feature in the view, {228} still looking to the right over the
principal part of the town. This valley is watered by a
little rivulet called Suke’s<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> run, which flows past a pleasant
retired situation, said to have been formerly inhabited by one
Anthony Thompson, long before Pittsburgh was a town.
A few indigenous plum trees are the only vestiges of its
former occupancy. The rivulet passes Mr. Watson’s large
brick house, supplies a tanyard owned by general O’Hara,
then crossing the Monongahela road, falls into that river
at the ship-yards, at a low inlet between Scots hill plain and
Boyd’s hill, where several vessels have been built, some as
large as four hundred tons. The coal which supplies Pittsburgh
with fuel, is brought on wagons from a distance not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>exceeding two miles, and is delivered in the town at six
cents a bushel.</p>

<p>Boyd’s hill was formerly named Ayre’s hill, from a
British engineer of that name who wished to have it fortified,
but it changed its appellation about twenty years
ago in consequence of one Boyd, a printer, hanging himself
there on a tree. It was first cleared and cultivated by a
Highland regiment, which built huts on it, no remains of
which now exist.</p>

<p>The view from Boyd’s hill exclusive of the Allegheny,
which is veiled by Grant’s and the Quarry hills, is as fine
as that from the Quarry hill exclusive of the Monongahela,
shut out from it by Boyd’s, and is more uninterrupted down
the Ohio to Robinson’s point and Brunot’s island, almost
three miles.</p>

<p>The Monongahela is then the next object to the right of
Boyd’s hill. It is four hundred and fifty yards wide, and
is seen to the N. E. in a vista of about two miles, when it
takes a sudden bend to the eastward, and disappears behind
the hills, at the extremity {229} of this vista, at the Two mile
run, Mr. Anthony Beelen, a respectable merchant, has a
neat ornamented cottage, opposite the bend, on the left
bank, which commands a view of the reach above, as well
as of that below to the town. The intermediate bank between
Mr. Beelen’s country seat and Pittsburgh, has a pleasant
road along it, which is one of the principal avenues to
the town, and which is surmounted by the ridge, of which
Boyd’s hill is the termination, whose round regular bluff
verges into a bare rock, crowned with trees, impending
romantically over the road in the whole distance from Two
mile run.</p>

<p>Still turning to the right the opposite bank of the Monongahela
presents to the eye a fine level bottom well cultivated
and settled, with a ridge of hills half a mile behind it, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>gradually approach the river until immediately opposite
the town, where rising abruptly from the water’s edge
to the height of about five hundred feet perpendicular, they
take the name of the Coal hill, from that fuel being formerly
dug out of it for the use of the town, before pits were opened
more convenient on this side of the river. It still supplies
the coal for general O’Hara’s glass-works, which, with the
houses of the overseer and workmen, forms a village at
the foot of the hill on the river bank, immediately opposite
the point where the spectator stands, who has now gone
round rather more than half a circle since his first view up
the Allegheny. Window glass of a good quality and quart
bottles, are made at this manufactury, which with a rival
one at New Geneva, about sixty miles up the Monongahela,
supplies all the western country.</p>

<p>The face of the Coal hill is very steep, and on the summit,
major Kirkpatrick<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> has a farm house and barn, which
seem to hang immediately over Pittsburgh, to a traveller
approaching from the north {230} eastern avenues. The
bird’s eye view from thence of the town and rivers is very
striking. Every street, lane, alley, house and object, however
minute (if visible to the eye) being delineated under the
spectator, as a plan on paper, the inequalities of surface not
being discernible, and even Grant’s hill being flattened to
a plain on the optick sense.</p>

<p>Continuing to turn to the right from our original centre,
the point, we see the Ohio for about two miles, with Elliot’s
mills on Saw-mill run below Coal hill on the left, an amphitheatre
of lower hills about Chartier creek and M’Kee’s
farm to Brunot’s island in front, and Robinson’s point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>and Smoky island at the mouth of the Allegheny on the
right.</p>

<p>The eye still keeping its circuit, looks over a fine level
of three thousand acres, once intended as the scite of a
town to be called Allegheny, to be the capital of the county,
but the situation of Pittsburgh being very properly judged
more convenient, it has eventually become the seat of justice
of the county, and the most flourishing inland town in the
United States. A chain of irregular hills, not so steep, but
nearly as high as Coal hill, bounds this level, and completes
the Panorama.</p>

<p>The plan of Pittsburgh by being designed to suit both the
rivers, is in consequence irregular. The ground plot is a
triangle. Some of the streets run parallel to each river,
until they meet at the point, and they again are intersected
by others at right angles, meeting at acute angles in the
centre. At one of those acute angles at a corner of Wood
street, is the Episcopal church, an octagonal building of
brick not yet finished, and nearly opposite on the other
side of the same street is a Presbyterian meeting-house of
brick also, well built, neat, and roomy. In a remote street
near Grant’s hill, is a small old framed Presbyterian meeting-house,
used by a sect a little differing from the other,
and the German Lutherans {231} have a small house of
worship near it—at the N. E. end of the town is a very
good brick meeting-house for a large congregation of Covenanters—and
without the town, near Mr. Woods’s handsome
seat, a handsome brick church is building for a society
of Roman Catholicks. The court-house in the centre of
the town is the only publick building which remains to be
mentioned.</p>

<p>It is well built of brick, is spacious, and convenient for
judiciary purposes, and serves for a place of worship for
the Episcopal society until their own church is finished, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>also occasionally for itinerant preachers to display their
oratory—and the jury room up stairs is sometimes converted
into a very good temporary theatre, where private
theatricals are practised in the winter by the young gentlemen
of the town.</p>

<p>A respectable society of Methodists meet at each others
houses, not having yet any house for that express purpose.</p>

<p>From the number of religious houses and sects, it may be
presumed that the sabbath is decently observed in Pittsburgh,
and that really appears to be the case in a remarkable
degree, considering it is so much of a manufacturing
town, so recently become such, and inhabited by such a
variety of people.</p>

<p>Amusements are also a good deal attended to, particularly
concerts and balls in the winters, and there are annual
horse races at a course about three miles from town, near
the Allegheny beyond Hill’s tavern.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>On the whole let a person be of what disposition he will,
Pittsburgh will afford him scope for the exercise of it.</p>

the commandant of the fort. John Scull remained the owner and proprietor until
1818, when he retired to Westmoreland County where he died ten years later.

<p>General William Irvine was a Scotch-Irish Revolutionary officer who had been
captured on the Canadian expedition (1776) and not exchanged until two years
later. Commissioned brigadier-general, he was sent by Washington, at a critical
juncture, to take command at Fort Pitt, and there remained until peace was signed
(1783). Thereupon he retired to Carlisle, and after distinguished public services
died in 1804. Pennsylvania granted him a tract of land near Erie in return for his
services.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="label">[160]</a> The career of General James Wilkinson is as remarkable as his character
is despicable. His adroitness and power of inspiring confidence maintained him
in his intrigues, and gave him the opportunity of playing a prominent part in early
Western affairs. His share in the Revolution was indicative of the man, he being
concerned in the Conway Cabal and other questionable movements. At the close
of the war, he migrated to Kentucky and engaged in mercantile business. His
commercial connection with New Orleans furnished the opportunity for his intrigue
with the Spaniards, whose paid agent he became, for attempting to dismember
the union. Returning to the army, he acted as second in command under Wayne.
Upon the latter’s death, he became commander-in-chief, and after 1805 was appointed
governor of Louisiana. In this position he first embarked upon, and then
betrayed the schemes of Aaron Burr. Not able entirely to clear himself of suspicion,
Wilkinson was removed from his Western position at the outbreak of the War
of 1812-15; and after a futile and mismanaged campaign against Montreal demanded
an investigation by court-martial. This being inefficiently conducted, Wilkinson
was acquitted, but he soon (1815) retired to extensive estates which he had acquired
near the City of Mexico, where he died ten years later.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

and the falls.</p>
</div>


<p>May 7th, at 8 P. M. departed from Maysville—8th,
the Ohio is safe and clear of obstructions from Maysville
to the Little Miami river, fifty-six miles.</p>

<p>Little Miami is a beautiful river, sixty or seventy yards
wide, falling into the Ohio on the right from the northward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>
<p>The village of Columbia just below, is beautifully situated
on an extensive bottom. Seven miles lower we passed on
the left the village of Newport, containing a large brick
arsenal and magazine, the property of the general government.
It is just above the conflux of Licking river, which
is about one hundred yards wide. The banks of the Ohio
display a great sameness so far, they having a gentle slope,
and rich soil, thickly wooded and thinly inhabited.</p>

<p>We stopped at Cincinnati which is delightfully situated
just opposite the mouth of Licking river.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>—This town
occupies more ground, and seems to contain nearly as many
houses as Lexington. It is on a double bank like Steubenville,
and the streets are in right lines, intersecting at right
angles. The houses are many of them of brick, and they are
all in general well built, well painted, and have that air of
neatness which is so conspicuous in Connecticut and Jersey,
from which latter state, this part of the state of Ohio is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>principally settled. Some of the new brick houses {233} are
of three stories with flat roofs, and there is one of four stories
now building. Mr. Jacob Burnet, an eminent lawyer, has a
handsome brick house beautifully situated just outside the
west end of the town.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Cincinnati, then named Fort
Washington, was one of the first military posts occupied by
the Americans in the western country, but I observed no
remains of the old fort. It is now the capital of Hamilton
county, and is the largest town in the state.</p>

<p>After remaining at Cincinnati from three o’clock until
half past five, we then proceeded, passing Col. Suydam’s
very handsome stone house with piazzas and balconies, in
the French West India style, three or four miles below.</p>

<p>May 9th, having passed the Big Miami, the boundary
between Ohio and the territory of Indiana in the night, at
seven in the morning we were abreast of Big Bone Lick creek,
so called from a skeleton of the mammoth being found
here.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> This is fifty-nine miles below Cincinnati. The
tiresome sameness of the banks continued until noon when
being abreast of one Reamy’s, thirty-two miles further, the
settlements became thicker on the Kentucky side, and the
river assumed a more cheerful appearance. I observed
some farms on the opposite shore of Indiana, at one of which
I was informed was a vineyard.</p>

<p>At three P. M. we stopped at Port William, delightfully
situated just above the embouchure of Kentucky river,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>which is from eighty to a hundred yards wide. This is the
capital of Gallatin county, and contains twenty-one houses,
many of which are of brick, but all rather in a state of decay.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
The lands appear good, but probably the country
is not in a sufficient state of improvement to admit of a town
here yet. Frankfort the capital of the state, is on the Kentucky,
only sixty miles above Port William.</p>

<p>{234} At four we gave our boats to the stream, and after
floating all night seventy-eight miles, past some islands and
some thinly scattering settlements, we rowed into Bear
Grass creek, which forms a commodious little harbour without
current for Louisville, May 10th, at 9 A. M.</p>

<p>Louisville is most delightfully situated on an elevated
plain to which the ascent from the creek and river is gradual,
being just slope enough to admit of hanging gardens with
terraces, which doctor Gault at the upper, and two Messrs.
Buttets at the lower end of the town have availed themselves
of, in laying out their gardens very handsomely and with
taste. From the latter, the view both up and down the
river is truly delightful. Looking upwards, a reach of five
or six miles presents itself, and turning the eye to the left,
Jeffersonville, a neat village of thirty houses, in Indiana,
about a mile distant, is next seen. The eye still turning a
little more to the left, next rests upon a high point where
general Clark first encamped his little army, about thirty
years ago, when he descended the river to make a campaign
against the Indians, at which time Louisville, and almost
the whole of Kentucky was a wilderness covered with forests.
The rapids or falls (as they are called) of the Ohio, are the
next objects which strike the observer. They are formed by
a range of rocks and low islands, which extend across the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>river, the deepest channel through which is near the Indiana
shore, and has only six feet water, and that even very narrow
when the river is low. The fall here has been proved
by a level to be twenty-two inches and a half in two miles,
from Bear Grass creek to Shipping Port, which causes a
velocity of current of about twelve miles an hour in the
channel. Clarksville, a new village in Indiana at the lower
end of the rapids, is next seen, beyond which Silver creek
hills, a moderately high and even chain, bound the view
five or six miles distant.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Continuing {235} to turn to the
left, Rock island, and the same chain of hills appearing over
it, finish two thirds of a very fine panorama. The town and
surrounding forests form the other third.</p>

<p>Louisville consists of one principal and very handsome
street, about half a mile long, tolerably compactly built,
and the houses generally superiour to any I have seen in the
western country with the exception of Lexington. Most
are of handsome brick, and some are three stories, with a
parapet wall on the top in the modern European taste,
which in front gives them the appearance of having flat
roofs.</p>

<p>I had thought Cincinnati one of the most beautiful towns
I had seen in America, but Louisville, which is almost as
large, equals it in beauty, and in the opinion of many excels
it. It was considered as unhealthy which impeded its
progress, until three or four years ago, when probably in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>consequence of the surrounding country being more opened,
bilious complaints ceased to be so frequent, and it is now
considered by the inhabitants as healthy as any town on the
river. There is a market house, where is a very good
market every Wednesday and Saturday. The court-house
is a plain two story stone building, with a square roof and
small belfry. There are bells here on the roofs of the taverns
as in Lexington, to summon the guests to their meals.
Great retail business is done here, and much produce is
shipped to New Orleans.</p>

<p>May 11.—At four P. M. Mr. Nelson, a pilot, came on
board and conducted the boats through the falls, by the
Kentucky schute, and in forty-five minutes we moored at
Shippingport, where we found commodore Peters’s boat
and officers, and captain Nevitt’s gun boat, all bound to
New Orleans in a few days.</p>

<p>{236} Shippingport is a fine harbour, there being no current
in it, but the banks are rather low, so as to be inundated
at very high floods.</p>

<p>Mr. Berthoud, who has a handsome house here, is connected
with Mr. Tarascon of Louisville in one of the finest
rope-walks in the United States. It is twelve hundred feet
long, of which seven hundred and fifty are covered.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>A little above the port is a mill wrought by the Ohio, the
race being formed by a small bank, which has been cut
through purposely.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_166" href="#FNanchor_166" class="label">[166]</a> The Licking was explored by Harrod’s party in 1774, and five years later
Bowman’s unfortunate expedition rendezvoused at its mouth. The next year
(1780) George Rogers Clark in his raid against the Chillicothe Indians built two
blockhouses on the site of Cincinnati; and again in 1782 started from hence against
the Miamis. In 1785-86, the Federal Government built Fort Finney above the
mouth of the Great Miami, where Clark held a treaty in the latter year. After
the erection of the Northwest Territory, and the opening of the district to landholders,
John Cleves Symmes bought a million acres between the two Miami
rivers, and towns were soon formed. Matthias Denman (1788) purchased of
Symmes for two hundred dollars a square mile opposite the mouth of the Licking,
and forming a partnership with Robert Patterson of Lexington, and John Filson, a
Kentucky schoolmaster, founded a town which the latter entitled Losantiville,
“town opposite the mouth of the Licking.” This fantastic compound was retained
until Governor St. Clair (1790) changed the name to Cincinnati in honor of
the military society. Fort Washington, government post, built in 1790, protected
the infant settlement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Symmes had platted a town on the Great Miami, which he called
North Bend, and desired to have established as the capital of the new Northwest
Territory. Columbia was also laid out at the mouth of the Little Miami, and the
three towns contended for leadership until Cincinnati was made capital of the
Territory in 1800, and began to flourish apace. The garrison was removed from
Fort Washington to Newport barracks in 1804. The residence of Colonel Suydam
has given its name to Suydamsville, a western suburb of Cincinnati.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

author of <i>Notes on the Early Settlement of the Northwestern Territory</i> (Cincinnati,
1847), a valuable pioneer history. Burnet’s home was the scene of noteworthy
hospitality, all prominent visitors to the region being there entertained. A portion

<p>Clarksville was established (1783) on the grant of lands given by the Virginia
legislature to the soldiers who had served in Clark’s campaign in the Illinois.
Much was expected of this new town opposite the Falls of Ohio; but it never flourished,
and gradually declined before its more prosperous neighbor, Jeffersonville
(founded in 1802), and has now become but a suburb of the manufacturing town
of New Albany. General George Rogers Clark had a home on a point of rocks

<p>May 12.—At six A. M. proceeded down the river, and
seven miles from Shippingport, passed Sullivan’s ferry, from
whence a road is traced one hundred and twenty miles to
Post Vincennes, the capital of Indiana.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The current of
the Ohio now carried us five miles an hour, passing settlements
on the right every mile with a range of picturesque
hills behind them.</p>

<p>Twenty-five miles from the falls, we passed Salt river,
about eighty yards wide, on the left, with some neat settlements
on each side of it, and also on the opposite bank of
the Ohio, which latter bank is overhung by some very high
rocky precipices. Twelve miles further on the left, we
stopped at Doe run to purchase necessaries. This is a small
creek, but has a thriving little settlement of half a dozen
families on its {237} banks. The price of provisions is here
as we had found it generally, viz. Butter 12½ cents per lb.,
eggs 6¼ cents per dozen, milk 6¼ cents per quart, fowls 12½
cents each, and turkies in proportion to their size from 25
to 50 cents each. At half past six, P. M. we passed Buck
creek on the right, five miles from Doe run, and half a mile
lower on the same side, we stopped and moored at an excellent
landing under a house on the bank.</p>

<p>May 13th, at dawn of day we went on, passing at two
miles and a half, on the right, a very remarkable rocky cliff
overhanging a cabin and small settlement. We passed
Indian creek and two islands in twelve miles more, and then
came to Blue river, on the right, fifty yards wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>The river hills, which are generally a considerable distance
behind the banks below Louisville, now approached
quite close on each side.</p>

<p>On each side of Blue river is a settlement, the uppermost
one three years old, but very little advanced, has a large
family of children and their mother almost naked. Nothing
apparently flourishing except a large garden of onions,
for a few of which with a pound or two of Indian meal to
make leaven, the woman would fix no price, but thinking
herself badly paid with a quarter of a dollar, I gave her an
eighth more to satisfy her. The lower settlement was
began two years ago by one Thomas Davidson, from Carlisle,
in Pennsylvania, and must become a fine property if
Mr. Harrison, the present governour of Indiana, succeeds
in establishing, according to his intentions, a ship yard on
Blue river, which is a most eligible situation for it. He has
already erected a grist and saw mill about eight miles up
it,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> where it is joined by a rivulet, which rising suddenly
from a spring in a prairie seventeen miles above the mill,
tinges the water from its source to its discharge into the
Ohio with a clear blue colour, which however {238} does
not effect its goodness, it being of an excellent quality.</p>

<p>Blue river itself is navigable for batteaux forty miles.</p>

<p>An old Indian trace, now the post road from Louisville
to Vincennes, crosses it at twenty-five miles from its mouth.</p>

<p>The distance from the governour’s mills to Vincennes,
is about one hundred miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>After leaving Blue river we went sixteen miles without
any settlement, and then passed a small one on the left.
The river having narrowed in that distance to less than a
quarter of a mile wide, and very crooked, with gently sloping
hills rising from the banks. Ten miles lower, on the
left, we came to the next settlement just began, and three
miles further passed Flint island, one mile long, with the
hull of a small ship on the upper end, stranded there in
descending last winter from Marietta.</p>

<p>When about three miles below Flint island, the wind
blowing very fresh ahead and causing a good deal of sea, we
stopped on the right shore abreast of Wheatly’s cabin, and
moored. Wheatly comes from Redstone in Pennsylvania,
and first lived on the opposite bank in Kentucky, where he
owned one thousand acres of land, which he was obliged
to part with from following boating and neglecting farming.
He has now three hundred and forty acres here, from six
of which that he has cleared, he raised last year five hundred
bushels of corn. He told us that a small tribe of Miami
Indians were encamped on Oil creek about two miles distant.
On asking if they were troublesome, he replied with
much sang froid, still splitting his log, “We never permit
them to be troublesome, for if any of them displease us,
we take them out of doors and kick them a little, for they are
like dogs, and so will love you the better for it.” This
doctrine might suit an athletick, active man, {239} upwards
of six feet high and in the prime of life, like Wheatly, but
I question whether the Indians would submit to it from
people less powerful. He informed us, that they frequently
get the Indians together, take their guns, knives and tomahawks
from them, then treat them with whiskey until they
are drunk, when they set them by the ears, to have the pleasure
of seeing them fight, at which they are so awkward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>(like young bears, according to his phrase) that they scuffle
for hours without drawing blood, and when their breath
is exhausted they will sit down quietly to recruit, and then
“up and at it again.”</p>

<p>We picked some fine wild greens (lamb’s quarters) and
got some milk, and next morning,</p>

<p>May 14th, proceeded. At eight miles below we passed
some good settlements on the right, and a ferry, from whence
a trace is opened seventy-five miles, to Vincennes. Leaving
Sinking creek on the right, and a large double log cabin
and very fine settlement on the left, ten miles more brought
us to squire Tobin’s on the Indiana side, where we landed
in the skiff. The squire has opened a fine farm in the three
years he has been from Redstone, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A keel of forty tons came to the landing at the same time
we did. She was worked by a horizontal wheel, kept in
motion by six horses going round in a circle on a gallery above
the boat, by which are turned two cog wheels fixed each to an
axle which projects over both gunwales of the boat, one
before and the other behind the horizontal wheel. Eight
paddles are fixed on the projecting end of each axle, which
impel the boat about five or six miles an hour, so that she
can be forced against the current about twenty miles a day.
One Brookfield, the owner, who conducts the boat, had her
built last year about two miles above Louisville, in Kentucky,
and then went in her to New Orleans, from whence
he was now {240} returning, disposing of a cargo of sugar
from place to place in his ascent. He expected to get home
and to commence a second voyage in about a month. Seven
horses had died during the voyage, and he had only two
remaining of the first set he had commenced with.</p>

<p>May 15th.—Having passed two more islands, and some
new farms, in nine miles and a half, we came to a string of
six or seven good looking settlements, called Scuffletown, on
the left, and two miles and a half farther on the right, we
observed two new settlements, a small creek, and a bluff
rock, serving as a base to an elevated conick promontory,
terminating a wide reach, and narrowing the river so by
its projection, as to make it an eligible situation for a fortified
post. Seven miles from hence we came to Green
river on the left, about two hundred yards wide. It falls
into the Ohio from the eastward, and at the junction the
latter river, changing its direction from S. W. to west, the view
of it upwards is lost, {241} and looking back to the eastward,
Green river appears to be a continuation of the Ohio.
Several new settlements are forming on the banks of Green
river, the climate and soil being well adapted to the culture
of cotton, but the former is esteemed unhealthy, the inhabitants
being very subject to intermittent fevers. A skiff
boarded us here from an ark astern, which was bound to
the mouth of the Ohio, from whence the people on board
were to proceed in a keel up the Mississippi to St. Genevieve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>in Upper Louisiana.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A few miles farther we spoke two
large loaded canoes bound upwards.</p>

<p>Nine miles below Green river, we passed a point of rocks
on the right—the only stone on the river between this
and Shawanee town, a distance of seventy miles, on which
account the section it lies in was bid up at publick sale to
ten dollars an acre, though the usual price is two. Three
miles from hence we left Blair’s ferry on the right, where a
road crosses from Kentucky, fifty-four miles to Vincennes.
A mile more brought us to Patterson’s on the right, where
we landed in the skiff. Mr. Patterson is a Scotchman
from Aberdeen, which he left before the revolutionary war,
going to Grenada in the West Indies, where he managed
the noble estate of Harvey’s plains (noted for its rum of much
superiour quality) nine years. The liver complaint forced
him to remove from thence to New York, where he married
and resided several years. He brought his family from
thence to this place last year. Mrs. Patterson thought
they were to find a country abundant in every thing, with
little or no trouble, but now, being undeceived by experience,
she jocularly remarked, that if the current of the river would
change, she would most gladly seize the occasion to return
immediately to where she came from. This family is settled
in a much more comfortable manner than the generality
of new planters. There were some neighbours on a {242}
visit, and the table was covered for supper in a very neat
and plentiful manner, which, with much hospitality, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>were pressed to partake of, but the boats having passed, we
could not stop.</p>

<p>Five miles from hence we stopped and moored for the
night at Henderson or Redbank. This is the county town
of Henderson county in Kentucky.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> It contains about
twenty wooden houses and cabins, including two stores and
two large tobacco warehouses. At a squire M’Bride’s we
saw a patent machine, which gins, cards and spins cotton,
all at once, by one person (it may be a child) turning a wheel.
Eight threads are spun at once, and wound upon eight spools.
It is ingenious and simple, and occupies no more room than
a small table.</p>

<p>About five hundred hogsheads of tobacco are shipped here
every year, and the place now begins to thrive a little, since
several wealthy people have settled in the neighbourhood,
and on Green river. From the opposite bank a road leads
to Vincennes, which is only fifty-two miles distant.</p>

<p>May 16th.—Proceeding, we went to the right of Redbank
island, and at twelve miles passed a ferry on the right,
and entered the right hand channel of Diamond island—there
being settlements every half mile. Nothing can be
more beautifully situated than this fine island. It is four
miles and a half long, and contains eight hundred acres of
the finest land, well timbered.</p>

<p>It takes its name from its form, which is that of a rhombus
or diamond. The river is above a quarter of a mile wide
all around it, and above half a mile wide below in a straight
reach of two or three miles. It is owned by a Mr. Alvis, a
Scotchman, of great property in South Carolina, who
bought it about two years ago of one Wells, the original locator.
Alvis has a negro quarter, and near one hundred and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>fifty acres of land cleared on the Kentucky shore opposite
{243} the island. This used to be the principal haunt of
a banditti, from twenty to thirty in number, amongst which
the names of Harper, five Masons, and Corkendale, were
the most conspicuous. They attacked and plundered the
passing boats, and frequently murdered the crews and
passengers. At length the government of Kentucky sent
a detachment of militia against them. They were surprised,
and Harper, one of the Masons and three or
four more were shot, one in the arms of his wife, who
escaped unhurt though her husband received eleven balls.
The rest dispersed, and again recruiting, became under
Mason the father, the terrour of the road through the wilderness
between Nashville in Tennessee and the Mississippi
Territory. About four years ago, two of the gang, tempted
by the reward of five hundred dollars for Mason dead or
alive, offered by the governour of Mississippi Territory, shot
him, carried his head to Natchez, received the promised
reward, which they expected, and a more just one which
they did not expect, being both found guilty of belonging to
the gang, and being executed accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to convey even a faint idea of the dangers
to which people descending those rivers were liable, until
within a few years that the population of the banks has
become general.</p>

<p>The Indians could not brook the intrusion of the whites
on the hunting grounds and navigable waters which they
had been in habits of considering as their own property
from time immemorial, and partly through revenge for
the usurpation of their rights, partly to intimidate others,
but chiefly from the hopes of booty, all the nations in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>neighbourhood of the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,
and the Mississippi, and even those more remote, used to
send detachments of warriours and hunters to lie in wait in
the narrow passes, and do their utmost to cut off all travellers,
in which they often succeeded through {244} their expertness
with the rifle; and it is not improbable but some
white desperadoes, under the appearance of Indians, were
guilty of atrocities of the same nature against their countrymen,
without the shadow of any of the excuses afforded
to the aborigines.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="label">[174]</a> The original village of Ste. Genevieve was about three miles south of the
present Missouri town of that name. The exact date of its founding is not known,
but it was upon a mining grant given to Regnault. A relic of a chimney found in
1881 bears the date 1732—possibly the first year of the settlement. The cession
of the Illinois to the English (1763) brought an accession of French inhabitants; and
in 1766, the Spanish ordered to Ste. Genevieve a commandant and garrison. The
earliest American inhabitants were John and Israel Dodge, the latter being father
of Governor Henry Dodge of Wisconsin. The encroachment of the river (about
1784-85) caused the old to be abandoned for the modern site.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Seven miles below Diamond island, we came to Straight
island, and nine miles further, to Slim island, which is three
miles and a half long, with a settlement on its upper end.</p>

<p>Highland creek, the mouth blocked up with drift, is three
miles below Slim island on the left, and opposite on the
Indiana shore are three families of Robinsons, the first settlements
in that distance. There is a fine landing just
below Highland creek, and two beautiful settlements owned
by Messrs. Cooper and Austin, and a framed house rented
by a Mr. Gilchrist, a temporary settler.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> We observed
several boats laid up here, which had lately brought families
down the river, which are all settled in the neighbourhood,
and a mile lower down, we passed the scite of an intended
town called Carthage, but where there is yet but one house.</p>

<p>Two miles and a half below, we entered the Indiana
sound of Wabash island, in a west direction, leaving the
Kentucky sound (forming a beautiful coup d’œil with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>small island and clump of trees directly in the centre) running
S. W. on the left.</p>

<p>{245} We would have gone through the latter sound, but
for a wish to see the Wabash,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the largest river in Indiana,
and upon which its capital Vincennes is seated. Its mouth
is overlapped from three miles above to two below by Wabash
island, which is five miles long and contains three thousand
acres.</p>

<p>The Wabash is a noble river, about three hundred yards
wide at its mouth, but its banks are so low, that they are
overflowed up to the eves of two cabins which are just above
its embouchure, at every high fresh. The inhabitants had
their cattle all drowned last spring, and were obliged to
save themselves by going some miles from the banks. The
cabin next the point where the two rivers join, is large and
has a tavern sign.</p>

<p>About three miles below the end of Wabash island, leaving
Brown’s island, and the two uppermost of the Three Sisters
on the right, we rowed to the Kentucky shore, and
moored for the night just under the cabin and well improved
farm of Peter Lash, who has been here four years, and informed
us, that there was a fine populous settlement of
several families behind us.</p>

<p>May 17th, we cast off at the dawn of day, passed the
third Sister, and a lake on the right which extends about
ten miles into the country, and abounds in fish, and at seven
miles from Lash’s we rowed in among some trees, and
moored and landed at Shawanee town.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>This was formerly an Indian settlement, the only vestiges
of which now remaining, are two barrows for interment at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>the upper end, and a growth of young trees all around the
town, which evince that the land has been cleared, at no
great distance of time back. The town now contains about
twenty-four cabins, and is a place of considerable resort on
account of the saline salt-works about twelve miles distant,
which supply with salt all the settlements within one {246}
hundred miles, and I believe even the whole of Upper
Louisiana.</p>

<p>The United States’ general government having reserved
to itself the property of the scite of this town, the salt licks,
and all the intermediate tract from Saline river, the inhabitants
have no other tenure than the permission of the governour
of the territory to reside there during his pleasure, so
they make no comfortable improvements, although they
appear to be in a very prosperous situation from their trade;
so much so, that they say, that it would immediately become
one of the most considerable towns on the river, if they
could purchase lots in fee simple.—There were several
trading boats at the landing, and more appearance of business
than I had seen on this side Pittsburgh. We walked
to the Indian burying ground, where we saw several human
bones, and picked up some of the small copper bells, used
by the natives as ornaments, which had been interred with
them, and which had become as thin and light as paper.</p>

<p>May 18th, proceeded nine miles to Saline river on the
right. This is a fine stream, fifty yards wide, navigable for
keels and batteaux. The salt-works are about twenty
miles up it with the turnings of the river, though not over
ten in a right line. There is a considerable hill on the
right, on the lower bank of this river where it joins the
Ohio.</p>

<p>Five miles from Saline river, we passed Battery rock,
which is a very remarkable point of rocks on the right,
with a cabin and farm beautifully situated on the hill above.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>We now began to see river hills again, rising to a moderate
height, from a little behind the banks on each side.</p>

<p>Four miles from hence we left Flinn’s ferry, where is a
very handsome settlement on the left. Three miles and a
half farther brought us to the upper end of Rocking cave
island, just above which the river is {247} a mile wide, and
in another mile we saw on the right Casey’s farm, where the
landing abounds in curious loose limestone petrifactions.
Two thirds of a mile from hence, we thought we saw the
Rocking cave, when we observed a cavern forty-five feet
deep, three wide, and nine high, the floor ascending gradually
to the vault at the end, where it is terminated by a
petrifaction, like the hanging pipes of a large organ.—The
sides which meet at the top, forming a Gothick arch, are of
limestone, with several large nuclei of flint, which seem to
have been broken off designedly to smooth the inside of the
cavern.</p>

<p>Rowing along shore with the skiff, we were soon undeceived
as to that’s being the Rocking cave, as a third of a mile
lower down, one of the finest grottos or caverns I have ever
seen, opened suddenly to view, resembling the choir of a
large church as we looked directly into it. We landed immediately
under it and entered it. It is natural, but is
evidently improved by art in the cutting of an entrance three
feet wide through the rock in the very centre, leaving a
projection on each hand excavated above to the whole
breadth of the cavern, the projections resembling galleries.
The height of the mouth is about twenty-two, and that
of the rock about thirty. It is crowned by large cedars
and black and white oaks, some of which impend over, and
several beautiful shrubs and flowers, particularly very rich
columbines, are thickly scattered all around the entrance.
The length (or depth) of the cavern is fifty-five paces, and
its breadth eleven or twelve.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>
<p>Standing on the outside, the appearance of some of the
company at the inner end of the cave was truly picturesque,
they being diminished on the eye to half their size, and
removed to three times their real distance.</p>

<p>On advancing twenty paces within, the path or aisle
gradually ascending has risen to the level of the {248} galleries,
and from thence to the end is a spacious apartment of the
whole breadth, ascending until it meets the rocky vault,
which is of bluish grey limestone. Twelve paces from the
end is a fissure in the vault, to which is fixed a notched
pole, to serve for a ladder, but the cavity has the appearance
of nothing more than a natural cleft in the rock, large enough
to admit the entrance of a man, and perhaps extending some
little distance sloping upwards.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>There is a perpendicular rocky bluff, just opposite the
lower end of Cave island, about two hundred yards above
the cave, where the river narrows to less than half a mile
wide, forming a fine situation for a fortification.</p>

<p>Half a mile below the Rocking cave, we stopped at
Perkins’s finely situated farm, where we feasted on some
good buttermilk, and bought some eggs, but on demanding
the price, and being asked by Mrs. Perkins, with an unblushing
face, four times as much as we had hitherto paid
for the first article, and twice as much as had ever been
demanded for the second, we left the eggs with her, and paid
her for the buttermilk, not however without telling her, how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>much she ought to be ashamed to take such advantage of
the necessities of travellers.</p>

<p>The right hand shore now consisted of bold projecting
rocks, with openings at intervals, in all of {249} which are
settlements, while the Kentucky side being low is more
thinly inhabited.</p>

<p>After passing Hurricane island, we came to Robins’s
ferry on the right, from whence is a road one hundred and
thirty miles to Kaskaskias on the Mississippi, and about
two miles lower on the left, we observed one of the finest
situations we had seen on the Ohio; it was a hill occupied
by a house and farm, opposite to a rectangular bend of the
river which forms a beautiful bason. Three miles further
on the right, is a hill with a remarkable face to the river, of
perpendicular rocks of a reddish colour, below which, is a
settlement and a creek, from whence Cumberland river is
twenty-five miles distant.</p>

<p>Four miles more brought us to Lusk’s ferry on the right,
now owned by one Ferguson from South Carolina, who has
a very good house and fine farm, with Little Bay creek
joining the Ohio just above. The main road from Kentucky
to Kaskaskias crosses here—the latter distant one
hundred and fifteen miles.</p>

<p>Having passed the Three Sisters’ islands and Big Bay
creek on the right, at eleven miles below Ferguson’s, we
rowed in to the right shore, and moored to some trees, where
we had a heavy storm all night, with thunder, lightning, and
hail as large as pigeons’ eggs.</p>

<p>May 19th, proceeding at early dawn, we passed Stewart’s
island on the left, and the first of Cumberland islands on
the right, just below which, we observed on the Indian
shore, the fine settlement we had seen from Big Bay creek,
nine miles.</p>

<p>With some difficulty and much rowing, we forced our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>boats into the narrow Kentucky channel of the second
Cumberland island a mile below the first, as otherwise we
should not have been able to have got into Cumberland
river, which the second island overlaps. A mile more
brought us to the entrance of {250} Cumberland river, across
which we rowed, and moored at the little town of Smithland.</p>

<p>This town contains only ten or a dozen houses and cabins,
including two stores, two taverns and a billiard table.
There appears to be only about thirty acres of land, badly
cleared and worse cultivated around it, though the soil
seems very good, but as it is as yet only considered as a
temporary landing to boats bound up and down Cumberland
river, the inhabitants depend on what they can
make by their intercourse with them, and are not solicitous
to cultivate more land than will suffice to give them maize
enough for themselves and their horses. They live chiefly
on bacon, which comes down the two rivers, and corn, being
too indolent to butcher or to fish, though they might raise
any quantity of stock, and doubtless the Ohio and Cumberland
both abound in fish. On the whole it is a miserable
place, and a traveller will scarcely think himself repaid by a
sight of the Cumberland, for stopping at Smithland.</p>

<p>There is an old Indian burying ground at the upper end
of the town, where we found several human bones enclosed
in thin flattish stone tombs close to the surface.</p>

<p>Cumberland river mixes its clear blue stream with the
muddy Ohio at an embouchure of about three hundred
yards wide. It is the principal river for business in the
state of Tennessee, Nashville the capital, being situated
on its banks, one hundred and eighty miles by water, and
one hundred and thirty by land, above its conflux with the
Ohio.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>May 20th, having parted with Mrs. Waters, her charming
daughter, and the rest of her family, they being destined
for Nashville, we cast off, and rowed out of Cumberland
river against the back water of the Ohio, whose true current
we took on turning the lower point of Cumberland.</p>

<p>{251} The first three miles brought us abreast of Lower
Smithland, a settlement on the left—having passed all
Cumberland islands, and after dropping four miles lower,
the sea ran so high, from a strong wind up the river, that
we judged it prudent to row in and moor under a low willow
point on the left, where we remained all the rest of the day
and night, and had a violent tornado at midnight, of thunder,
lightning, wind, and rain.</p>

<p>May 21st, we proceeded early this morning and at five
miles and a half passed the mouth of Tennessee river joining
the Ohio on the left from the S. E. and nearly half a mile
wide. There are two islands at its mouth, the second one
of which has an abandoned settlement on it. In the next
eleven miles we passed three small settlements on the right,
being the first habitations we had seen below Lower Smithland,
and at noon, a mile below the last, we rowed into the
mouth of a creek at the bottom of a bay, which forming an
eddy, makes a fine landing for boats of all sizes, on the right
shore.</p>

<p>On fastening the boat, a corporal from Fort Massack
just above the landing, came on board, and took a memorandum
of our destination, &amp;c. We landed, and approaching
the fort, we were met by lieutenant Johnston, who very
politely shewed us the barracks, and his own quarters
within the fort, in front of which is a beautiful esplanade,
with a row of Lombardy poplars in front, from whence is a
view upwards to Tennessee river, downwards about two
miles, and the opposite shore which is one mile and a quarter
distant—the Ohio being now so wide.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>
<p>The fort is formed of pickets, and is a square, with a
small bastion at each angle. The surrounding plain is
cleared to an extent of about sixty acres, to serve for exercising
the garrison in military evolutions, and also to prevent
surprise from an enemy. On the esplanade is a small
brass howitzer, and a {252} brass caronade two pounder,
both mounted on field carriages, and a centinel is always
kept here on guard. The garrison consists of about fifty
men. Some recruits were exercising. They were clean,
and tolerably well clothed, and were marched in to the barrack
yard preceded by two good drums and as many fifes.
The house of captain Bissel the commandant, is without
the pickets.</p>

<p>Though the situation of Massack is pleasant and apparently
healthy, it is a station which will only suit such officers
as are fond of retirement, as there is no kind of society
out of the garrison, and there are only a few settlements
in the neighbourhood, which supply it with fresh stock.</p>

<p>This was one of the chain of posts which the French occupied
between Detroit and Orleans, when that nation possessed
Canada and Louisiana. It had fallen into ruin,
but it has been reconstructed by the United States’ government.
It keeps its original name, which it derived from a
massacre of the French garrison by the Indians.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>At one o’clock we proceeded on our voyage, and in half
a mile turning a little to the right with the river, we entered
a very long reach in a W. N. W. direction, and at three
miles passed a new settlement on the right where the river
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>is two miles wide, with a very gentle current. The current
carried us twelve miles and a half farther, without our perceiving
any signs of inhabitants on either shore, we then
rowed in to Cedar Bluffs or Wilkinsonville, where we found
an eddy making a fine harbour, and an ascent up a low
cliff by sixty-two steps of squared logs, to a beautiful savannah
or prairie of about one hundred acres, with well frequented
paths through and across it in every direction. We
observed on it, the ruins of the house of the commandant,
and the barracks which were occupied by a small United
States’ garrison, until a few years ago, when it was removed
{253} to Fort Massack; some time after which, about two
years ago, the buildings were destroyed by the Indians.</p>

<p>Though our harbour here was a good one, yet we did
not spend our night with perfect ease of mind, from the
apprehension of an unwelcome visit from the original lords
of this country, recent vestiges of whom we had seen in the
prairie above us.</p>

<p>May 22nd, at day break we gladly cast off, and at a mile
below Wilkinsonville, turned to the left into a long reach in
a S. W. by S. direction, where in nine miles farther, the river
gradually narrows to half a mile wide, and the current is
one fourth stronger than above. Three miles lower we saw
a cabin and small clearing on the right shore, apparently
abandoned, five miles below which we landed in the skiff,
and purchased some fowls, eggs, and milk, at a solitary but
pleasant settlement on the right just below Cash island. It
is occupied by one Petit with his family, who stopped here
to make a crop or two previous to his descending the
Mississippi, according to his intention on some future
day.</p>

<p>Two miles and a half from hence we left Cash river, a
fine harbour for boats about thirty yards wide at its mouth,
on the right, and from hence we had a pleasant and cheerful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>view down the river, in a S. S. E. direction five miles to
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>First on the right just below the mouth of Cash river,
M’Mullin’s pleasant settlement, and a little lower a cabin
occupied by a tenant who labours for him. A ship at
anchor close to the right shore, three miles lower down,
enlivened the view, which was closed below by colonel
Bird’s flourishing settlement on the south bank of the Mississippi.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>We soon passed and spoke the ship, which was the Rufus
King, captain Clarke, receiving a cargo of tobacco, &amp;c. by
boats down the river from Kentucky, and intended to proceed
in about a week, on a voyage {254} to Baltimore. It
was now a year since she was built at Marietta, and she had
got no farther yet.</p>

<p>At noon we entered the Mississippi flowing from E. above,
to E. by S. below the conflux of the Ohio, which differs considerably
from its general course of from north to south.</p>

</div>


<p>We had thought the water of the Ohio very turbid, but
it was clear in comparison of the Mississippi, the two rivers
being distinctly marked three or four miles after their junction.
The Ohio carried us out almost into the middle of
the Mississippi, so that I was almost deceived into thinking
that the latter river ran to the westward instead of to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>eastward; by the time however that we were near midchannel
the Mississippi had gained the ascendancy, and we were
forced to eastward with encreased velocity, its current being
more rapid than that of the Ohio. We soon lost sight of the
labyrinth of waters formed by the conflux of the two rivers,
and quickly got into a single channel, assuming gradually
its usual southerly direction. We now began to look for
Fort Jefferson, marked in Mr. Cramer’s Navigator as just
above Mayfield creek on the left, but not seeing either we
supposed they were concealed by island No. 1 acting as a
screen to them.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>At fifteen miles from the Ohio, we observed a fine new
settlement on the right, with the boats moored {255} at the
landing which had brought the family down the river.</p>

<p>Five miles lower we passed the Iron banks on the left.
These are very remarkable, being a red cliff near the top of a
high ridge of hills about a mile long, where the river is narrowed
to little more than a quarter of a mile wide.</p>

<p>From the Iron banks a fine bay of a mile in breadth is
terminated by the Chalk bank, which is a whitish brown
bluff cliff, rising from the water’s edge, surmounted by a
forest of lofty trees. Having passed some other islands, we
made a harbour for the night on Wolf island just opposite
Chalk bank, about three miles below the Iron banks.</p>

<p>May 23d.—A steady rain did not prevent our proceeding
this morning. We found the river generally from half to
three quarters of a mile wide, and the navigation rather
intricate on account of the number of islands and sand-bars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>which gave us some trouble to keep clear of. The rain
ceased about three o’clock, when it cleared up calm and hot.
At 4 o’clock we passed Island No. 10, on the right. The
singing of the birds on this island exceeded every thing of
the kind I had ever before heard in America. Notes resembling
the wild clear whistle of the European black birds,
and others like the call of the quail, or American partridge,
were particularly distinguishable among a wonderful variety
of feathered songsters. The island probably bears some
vegetable production peculiar to itself, which attracts such
uncommon numbers of small birds.</p>

<p>At seven, P. M. we rowed into Bayou St. Jean, on the
right, at the upper end of New Madrid, to which settlement
it serves for a harbour,—having only advanced about fifty
miles this whole day. We found here several boats bound
down the river.</p>

<p>New Madrid contains about a hundred houses, much
scattered, on a fine plain of two miles square, {256} on
which however the river has so encroached during the
twenty-two years since it was first settled, that the bank is
now half a mile behind its old bounds, and the inhabitants
have had to remove repeatedly farther back. They are a
mixture of French Creoles from Illinois, United States
Americans, and Germans. They have plenty of cattle,
but seem in other respects to be very poor. There is some
trade with the Indian hunters for furs and peltry, but of
little consequence. Dry goods and groceries are enormously
high, and the inhabitants charge travellers immensely for
any common necessaries, such as milk, butter, fowls, eggs,
&amp;c. There is a militia, the officers of which wear cockades
in common as a mark of distinction, although the rest of
their dress should be only a dirty ragged hunting shirt and
trowsers.—There is a church going to decay and no preacher,
and there are courts of common pleas and quarter sessions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>from which an appeal lies to the supreme court at St. Louis,
the capital of the territory of Upper Louisiana, which is two
hundred and forty miles to the northward, by a wagon road
which passes through St. Genevieve at 180 miles distance.—On
account of its distance from the capital, New Madrid
has obtained a right to have all trials for felony held and
adjudged here without appeal.</p>

<p>The inhabitants regret much the change of government
from Spanish to American, but this I am not surprised at,
as it is the nature of mankind to never be satisfied.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>We had observed no settlements between the Ohio and
New Madrid except one new one before mentioned.</p>

<p>May 24th.—At eight, A. M. we left New Madrid, and
after toiling until three, P. M. against a fresh southerly
wind, when we had advanced only eleven miles, we were
forced to shore on the left, and hauling through some willows
which broke off {257} the sea, moored and remained
there until four A. M.</p>

<p>May 25th—when we were awoke to the enjoyment of a
delightful morning, by the enchanting melody of the birds
saluting the day, while the horn of a boat floating down the
far side of the river, was echoed and re-echoed from both
shores, to all which we added, with fine effect, some airs on
the clarionet and the octave flute. When we hauled out of
the willows, several boats were in sight, which added much
to the cheerfulness of the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Having passed several islands, we saw on the right the
settlement of one Biddle, being the first on the river since
four miles below New Madrid.</p>

<p>Four miles lower we landed in the skiff at the town of
Little Prairie on the right, containing twenty-four low
houses and cabins, scattered on a fine and pleasant plain
inhabited chiefly by French creoles from Canada and
Illinois. We were informed that there were several Anglo-American
farmers all round in a circle of ten miles. We
stopped at a tavern and store kept by a European Frenchman,
where we got some necessaries.</p>

<p>Every thing is excessively dear here, as in New Madrid—butter
a quarter of a dollar per pound, milk half a dollar per
gallon, eggs a quarter of a dollar a dozen, and fowls half
to three quarters of a dollar each.</p>

<p>We found here five lumber loaded boats owned by Mr.
Holmes of Meadville, which had left Pittsburgh about the
20th of March. Three of them had been stove, and they
were going to unload and repair them.</p>

<p>Continuing to coast along in the skiff, while our ark fell
down the river with the current, we landed about a mile
below Little Prairie, at an Indian camp formed by the
crews of three canoes, all Delawares except one Chocktaw.
They had sold their peltry {258} and were now enjoying their
whiskey, of which they had made such liberal use as to be
most of them quite drunk. They did not seem to like our
intrusion, but on our demanding whiskey from them, and
drinking with them, they became more social.</p>

<p>Two miles below the Indian camp we again overtook our
boat from which we had been absent the last fourteen miles,
and seven miles lower, met a canoe with two Indians, who
wanted to sell us skins.—After passing several islands as
far as No. 21, of Mr. Cramer’s Navigator, in twelve miles
farther, we came to one not mentioned in the Navigator,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>which we named Mansfield’s island, from one of our passengers
who was the first to land on it. It was a beautiful
little island, and the evening being far advanced, we were
tempted to moor at its west point, to some willows on a fine
hard sand, but we had nothing to boast of our choice of
situation, as myriads of musquitoes effectually prevented
our sleeping all night.</p>

1781, Fort Jefferson was besieged by the Chickasaws under the lead of a half-breed,

<p><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="label">[185]</a> New Madrid was originally the site of a Delaware Indian town, at which two
Canadians, named LeSueur, established a trading-house in 1780. Eight years later
Colonel George Morgan attempted to obtain a large concession from the Spanish
government to establish an American colony at this point, with rights of local
self-government. Morgan brought out the first installment of colonists, but the
arrangements at New Orleans which were to confirm his title to the grant failed
of completion. The Spanish authorities sent Lieutenant Pierre Foucher, with a
garrison of ninety men, to command here in 1789. A settlement of a heterogeneous
character, as Cuming indicates, gradually grew up around the fort. The later
history of New Madrid is chiefly concerned with the disastrous earthquakes of
1811-12, and the congressional grant of relief for the settlers.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="hanging-indent1">Visit from Indian warriours—Our apprehensions—Indian
manners and customs not generally known—First,
Second and Third Chickasaw Bluffs, and several islands.</p>
</div>


<p>May 26.—We drifted forty-three miles, between five
o’clock, A. M. and five o’clock P. M.—passing several
islands and sand-bars, and had got between island No. 31
and Flour island, when an Indian canoe from the left shore
boarded us with a chief and three warriours of the Shawanee
nation.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> They had their rifles in the boat, and their
knives {259} and tomahawks in their belts, and it is my
opinion that their intentions were hostile had they seen any
thing worth plundering, or found us intimidated—but by
receiving them with a confident familiarity, and treating
them cautiously with a little whiskey, they behaved tolerably
well, and bartered a wild turkey which one of them had shot
for some flour, though it might have been supposed that they
would have made a compliment of it to us in return for our
civility to them, as besides giving them whiskey to drink,
we had given them good wheat loaf bread to eat, and had
filled a bottle they had in their canoe with whiskey for their
squaws at the camp. It is remarked, that the Indians are
not in habits of generous acts, either through the niggardliness
of nature, or selfish mode of bringing up; or it may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>owing to their intercourse with the white hunters and traders,
who take every advantage of them in their dealings, and so
set them an example of selfishness and knavery, which they
attempt to follow. Our skiff which had been absent with
some of the passengers now coming on board, encreased our
numbers so as to render us more respectable in the eyes of our
troublesome visitors, and being abreast of their camp,
where the party appeared pretty numerous, they shook
hands with, and left us, to our great joy, as we were not
without apprehension that they would have received a reinforcement
of their companions from the shore, which in our
defenceless state would have been a most disagreeable circumstance.</p>

<p>They were well formed men, with fine countenances,
and their chief was well drest, having good leggins and
mockasins, and large tin ear-rings, and his foretop of hair
turned up, and ornamented with a quantity of beads.</p>

<p>Evening approaching, we plied our oars diligently, to
remove ourselves as far as possible from the Indian camp
before we should stop for the night, and by six {260} o’clock
we had the upper end of Flour island on our right, three
miles below where the Indians had left us. The river making
a sudden bend here from east to south, we lost sight of
the smoke of the camp, and of our apprehensions also, and
about a mile farther, seeing a South Carolina and a Pittsburgh
boat moored at the left bank, we rowed in and joined
them. Near the landing was a newly abandoned Indian
camp, the trees having been barked only within a day or
two. To explain this it may be proper to observe, that the
Indians, who are wanderers, continually shifting their
hunting ground, form their temporary huts with two forked
stakes, stuck in the ground, at from six to twelve feet apart,
and from four to six feet high. A ridge pole is laid from
fork to fork, and long pieces of bark stripped from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>neighbouring trees, are placed on their ends at a sufficient
distance below, while the other ends overlap each other
where they meet at the ridge pole, the whole forming a hut
shaped like the roof of a common house, in which they
make a fire, and the men, when not hunting, lounge at full
length wrapped in their blankets, or sit cross legged, while
the women do the domestick drudgery, or make baskets of
various shapes with split cane, which they do with great
neatness, and a certain degree of ingenuity. If any of the
men die while on an excursion, they erect a scaffold about five
feet high, on which they place the corpse covered with the
skin of a deer, a bear, or some other animal they have killed
in hunting. The dead man’s rifle, tomahawk, bow and
arrows are placed along side of him on the scaffold, to which
the whole is bound with strings cut from some hide. It is
then surrounded with stout poles or stakes, ten or twelve
feet long, drove firmly into the ground and so close to each
other as not to admit the entry of a small bird. Some of
the female relations, are left in the hut close to the scaffold,
until the excursion is {261} finished; when, ere they return
home to their nation, they bury the corpse with much
privacy.—I had been informed that some priest or privileged
person, who was called the bone picker, was always sent
for to the nation to come and cleanse the bones from the
flesh even in the most loathsome state of putrefaction, that the
bones might be carried home and interred in the general
cemetery, but I had frequent opportunities of proving the
error of this opinion. As to the women, when they die,
(which is very rare, except from old age) they are buried at
once on the spot, with little or no ceremony. While on
the subject of Indians, it may not be amiss to mention a
trait in their character, of courage and submission to their
laws, of which numberless instances have happened, particularly
amongst the Chocktaws on the frontier of the Mississippi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>Territory, and I believe common to all the Indian
nations, which I do not recollect being noticed by any
writer on the subject of their manners and customs. If any
one maims or mutilates another, in a drunken or private
fray, he must forfeit his life. A few days (or if necessary)
even a few months, are allowed the offender to go where he
pleases and settle his affairs, at the expiration of which it
has rarely if ever happened, that he does not surrender
himself at the place appointed, to submit himself to the
rifle of the injured party, or one of his nearest relatives, who
never fails to exact the full penalty, by shooting the criminal.
This is a very common circumstance, and is an instance of
national intrepidity and obedience to the laws, not excelled
in the purest times of the Roman republick.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>We were now dreadfully tormented by musquitoes and
gnats, particularly at night, when moored {262} to the bank.
By day, while floating in the middle of the river, they were
less troublesome. I would recommend it to travellers about
to descend the Ohio and Mississippi, to provide themselves,
previous to setting off, with musquitoe curtains, otherwise
they never can reckon on one night’s undisturbed repose,
while on their journey, during the spring, summer or autumn.</p>

<p>May 27th.—We proceeded this morning early with the
other two boats in company, and passing Flour island (so
named from the number of flour loaded boats which formerly
were thrown on it by the current and lost) the first two miles
brought us abreast of the first Chickasaw Bluffs, on the left.
It is a cliff of pale orange coloured clay, rising from a base
of rocks on the bank of the river, and surmounted by trees.—Half
a mile below, another similar cliff rises suddenly from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>the water’s edge, the two being connected by a semicircular
range of smaller ones receding from the bank, having a small
willow bottom in front of them.</p>

<p>The river retaining its southerly course, floated us in
another half league, past the beginning of island No. 34 of
Cramer’s Navigator, which is four miles and a half long,
at the end of which, another large island (not mentioned in
the Navigator, but probably included in No. 34, from which
only a narrow channel separates it) begins. Two miles
from hence a handsome little creek or river, about forty
yards wide, joins the Mississippi from the N. E. and nearly
a mile lower is another small creek from the eastward with
willows at its mouth.</p>

<p>The second Chickasaw Bluff, which we had seen in a long
reach down the river ever since we passed Flour island,
commences at a mile below the last creek, on the left hand.
The cliff, of a yellowish brown colour, has fallen in from
the top of the bluff, which is about one hundred and fifty
feet high, and immediately after is a cleft or deep fissure,
through {263} which, a small creek or run enters the river.
Half a mile lower down, the foundation of the cliff, formed
apparently of potter’s blue clay, assumes the appearance
of the buttresses of an ancient fortification, projecting to
support the huge impending yellowish red cliff above, the
base of the whole next the water being a heap of ruins in
fantastick and various forms, perpetually tumbling from
the cliff, which is beautifully streaked with horizontal lines,
separating the different strata of sand and clay of which it is
composed.</p>

<p>The second bluffs are about two miles long, and form
the interior of a great bend of the river, which curves from
S. W. by S. to N. W. where being narrowed to a quarter
of a mile wide between the bluff and the island, (on which
the passengers had bestowed the name of Cuming’s island)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>the current is so rapid and sets so strongly into the bend as
to require the greatest exertion of the oars to keep the boat
in the channel. The river then turns a little to the left,
and keeping a W. by N. course for three or four miles, then
resumes its general direction, meandering to the southward.</p>

<p>A mile and a half below the bluffs, island No. 35 commences,
doubling over Cuming’s island, whose lower point
is not in sight, being concealed by No. 35. The view of the
river and islands from the top of the bluff must be very fine.</p>

<p>No. 35 is three miles long. From the lower end of this
island we saw the Third Chickasaw Bluffs bearing east
about six or seven miles distant, at the end of a vista formed
by the left hand channel of island No. 36, and appearing to
be a little higher than the First or Second Bluffs, but without
any marked particularity at that distance.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Rowing into the right hand channel of No. 36, we entered
the Devil’s Race-ground, as the sound is called between the
island and the main, from the number of snags and sawyers
in it, and the current setting strongly on the island, which
renders it necessary to use the oars with continued exertion,
by dint of which we got safely through this dangerous passage
of three miles, leaving several newly deserted Indian
camps on the right. At the end of the Devil’s Race-ground
the river turns from S. W. by W. to N. N. W. and here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>opposite a small outlet of twenty yards wide on the left,
we met a barge under sail, bound up the river.</p>

<p>After three miles on the last reach the river turns gradually
with a bend, to its general southerly direction, the bend
being encircled by a low bank covered with tall cypresses,
which keep the traveller in constant dread of falling on his
boat, which in spite of his utmost exertion is forced by an
irresistible current close into the bend. The two other
boats stopped here among some willows on account of a
breaking short sea raised by a fresh southerly wind.</p>

<p>Nine miles from the Devil’s Race-ground, we came to
the Devil’s Elbow, which is a low point on the left, round
which the river turns suddenly, from S. W. to S. and from
that to E. an island being in front to the southward, which
intercepts the drifts, and fills the river above half channel
over with snags and sawyers. There was a very large flock
of swans {265} on the low sandy point of the Elbow. These
were the first swans we had seen on the river, although they
are said to abound throughout this long tract which is destitute
of inhabitants. We had been long accustomed to see
numbers of bitterns and cranes, mostly white as snow, and a
few grey ones, and some duck and teal sometimes shewed
themselves, but took care to keep out of gun shot. Travellers
descending the river have but little chance of obtaining
any game, as its having become so great a thoroughfare,
has rendered both the four footed, and feathered tribes
fit for the table so wild, that it is rare that any of them,
even when seen can be shot, and if one lands for the purpose
of hunting, the boat must stop, or else he is in danger of
being left behind, as the current runs never or in no place
slower than three miles an hour, and mostly four or five.</p>

<p>The easterly bend is six miles long, and about a mile
wide, gradually inclining to the south, and on the right
are eight creeks or outlets of the river, five of them divided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>from each other by narrow slips of land about fifty paces
wide each, and the other three by slips of one hundred and
fifty paces. Their general direction from the river is S.
S. W. and a point rounds the whole way from E. to S. E.—This
is one of the most remarkable situations on the river.</p>

<p>Two miles lower we stopped at island No. 40, for the
night, and moored by some willows at a sand beach, near
a drift tree, the trunk of which was one hundred and twenty-five
feet long, and from its thickness where broken towards
the top, it must have been at least fifty feet more to the
extremity of the branches, making in the whole the astonishing
length of one hundred and seventy-five feet. Capt.
Wells with two boats from Steubenville, passed and stopped
a little below us.</p>

<p>The Musquitoes as usual plagued us all night, and hastened
our departure at four o’clock in the morning. {266}
Wells’s boats were in company, and after floating six miles,
we overtook two other boats from Steubenville under the
direction of captain Bell.—The four boats had twelve
hundred barrels of flour for the New Orleans market.</p>

<p>This accession to our company served to enliven a little
the remainder of this dreary and solitary part of the river,
the sameness of which had began to be irksome.</p>

<p>In a league more Bell’s boats took the right hand channel
round an archipelago of islands, while we kept to the left
through Mansfield’s channel, which is very narrow and
meanders among several small islands and willow bars.</p>

<p>This archipelago which is designated by No. 41 in the
Navigator, is three miles long. At the end of it we rejoined
Bell’s boats, and passed a settlement pleasantly situated on
the right, which was the first habitation since Little Prairie
(one hundred and thirty-two miles.) Here we observed a
fine stock of horses, cows, and oxen, and half a mile farther
we landed in the skiff at Mr. Foy’s handsome settlement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>and good frame house. Foy was the first settler fourteen
years ago on the Fourth Chickasaw Bluffs, which are opposite
his present residence, to which he removed eleven years
ago; since when five families more have settled near him,
and about half a dozen on the Chickasaw side, just below
Wolf river. Soon after Foy’s first settlement, and very near
it, the Americans erected a small stoccado fort, named Fort
Pike, from the major commandant. After the purchase of
Louisiana by the United States from the Spaniards, Fort
Pickering was erected two miles lower down at the end of
the bluffs, and Fort Pike was abandoned. There are two
stores on each side the river, one of which is kept by Mr.
Foy, who owns a small barge which he sends occasionally
for goods to New Orleans, from whence she returns {267}
generally in forty days, and did so once in thirty. Mrs. Foy
was very friendly, amongst other civilities, sparing us some
butter, for which she would accept no payment. This was
the first instance of disinterestedness we had experienced on
the banks of the rivers.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Wolf river is the boundary between the state of Tennessee
and the Mississippi territory. It is not more than about
forty yards wide. The bank of the Ohio and the Mississippi,
the whole way from Tennessee river is still owned by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>Chickasaw nation, who have not yet sold the territorial
right.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>On the point immediately below Mr. Foy’s (whose negro
quarter gives his pleasantly situated settlement the appearance
of a village or hamlet) was formerly a Spanish fort
no vestige of which now remains.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Rowing across the river and falling down with the current,
we landed under Fort Pickering, having passed the Fourth
Chickasaw Bluffs, which are two miles long, and sixty feet
perpendicular height. They are cleared at the top to some
little distance back, and the houses of the settlers are very
pleasantly situated near the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>An Indian was at the landing observing us. He was
painted in such a manner as to leave us in doubt as to his
sex until we noticed a bow and arrow in his hand. His
natural colour was entirely concealed under the bright vermillion,
the white, and the blue grey, with which he was
covered, not frightfully, but in such a manner as to mark
more strongly, a fine set of features on a fine countenance.
He was drest very fantastically in an old fashioned, large
figured, high coloured calico shirt—deer skin leggins and
mockesons, ornamented with beads, and a plume of beautiful
heron’s feathers nodding over his forehead from the
back of his head.</p>

<p>We ascended to Fort Pickering<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> by a stair of one hundred
and twenty square logs, similar to that at {268} Jeffersonville.
There was a trace of fresh blood the whole way up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>the stair, and on arriving at the top, we saw seated or lazily
reclining on a green in front of the entrance of the stoccado,
about fifty Chickasaw warriours, drest each according to
his notion of finery, and most of them painted in a grotesque
but not a terrifick manner. Many of them had long feathers
in the back part of their hair, and several wore breast plates
formed of tin in the shape of a crescent, and had large tin
rings in their ears.</p>

<p>On seeing so many Indians and the trace of blood before
mentioned, an idea started in my imagination that they had
massacred the garrison, but on advancing a little farther, I was
agreeably undeceived by seeing a good looking young white
centinel in the American uniform, with his musquet and fixed
bayonet, parading before the gate of the fort. He stopped
us until permission was obtained from the commanding
officer for our entrance, and in the interim he informed me
that he was a Frenchman, a native of Paris, that he had
been a marine under Jerome Bonaparte, when the latter
commanded a frigate, and that he had deserted from him on
his arrival in the Chesapeak. We were ushered by a soldier
to the officers’ quarters where we were received by lieut.
Taylor the commandant, with civility not unmixed with
a small degree of the pompous stiffness of office.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> He
however answered politely enough a few interrogatories we
made respecting the Indians. He said they were friendly,
and made frequent visits to the garrison, but except a few
of the chiefs on business, none of them were ever admitted
within the stoccado, and that this was a jubilee or gala day,
on account of their having just received presents from the
United States’ government. They have a large settlement
about five miles directly inland from the river, but the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>populous part of the Chickasaw nation is one hundred miles
distant to the south eastward.</p>

<p>{269} When we were returning to the boat, one of the
Indians offered to sell us for a mere trifle, a pair of very
handsome beaded mockesons, which we were obliged to decline,
from having neglected to bring any money with us.</p>

<p>Fort Pickering is a small stoccado, commanding from its
elevated situation not only the river, but also the surrounding
country, which however is not yet sufficiently cleared of
wood to make it tenable against an active enemy. There
are some small cannon mounted, and several pyramids of
shot evince its being well supplied with that article.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189" class="label">[189]</a> The first fort known to have been erected on the site of Memphis (Fourth
Chickasaw Bluff) was that built by Bienville, governor of Louisiana, during his
campaigns against the Chickasaws (1735-40) and called by him Fort Assumption.
After the expedition of 1740, however, this was abandoned, the place not being
fortified until the Spanish commandant Gayoso, in defiance of the authority of the
United States, crossed (1794) to the Chickasaw territory and built Fort San Fernando.
Two years later, after Pinckney’s treaty was signed, the Spaniards reluctantly
surrendered this outpost, whereupon the American Fort Pike was built
(1796).</p>

<p>Judge Benjamin Foy, of the Arkansas town of Foy’s Point, was a pioneer of
German descent, whose settlement is said to have been the most healthful, moral,

<p>A mile below Fort Pickering we passed a pleasantly
situated settlement on a detached bluff on the left, and from
thence eight miles lower we had an archipelago of islands
on the right. We found this passage very good, though the
Navigator advises keeping to the right of the first and largest
island, named No. 46. Having passed Council island, four
miles long, and several willow islands and sand bars, in the
twenty-seven miles which we floated during the remainder
of the day, we then at sunset stopped and moored in a little
eddy under a point on the left, where several stakes drove
into the strand indicate a well frequented boat harbour.
We found adjoining the landing, a beautiful little prairie,
and our being comparatively less troubled than usual with
gnats {270} and musquitoes, made us congratulate ourselves
on the situation we had chosen for the night. Next morning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>May 30th, we continued our voyage with charming
weather.</p>

<p>We passed several islands, and some very intricate channels,
where we were obliged occasionally to work our oars
with the utmost exertion, to avoid snags, sawyers, and improper
sucks.</p>

<p>We this day spoke a large barge with some military
officers on board from Fort Adams, bound to Marietta, with
another following her, and having floated thirty-two miles,
we passed the mouth of the river St. Francois on the right,
but we could not see it on account of the overlapping
of two willow points, which veil it from passengers on the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>The river St. Francois rises near St. Louis in Upper
Louisiana, and runs parallel to the Mississippi, between
three and four hundred miles, between its source and its
embouchure into that river.</p>

<p>The tongue of land between the two rivers, is only from
six to twenty miles wide in that whole distance, is all flat,
and great part of it liable to inundation in great floods.
There is a chain of hills along the whole western bank of the
St. Francois, and in this chain, are the lead mines of St.
Genevieve, immediately behind that settlement, which
supply all the states and territories washed by the Ohio
and the Mississippi, and all their tributary streams, with
that useful metal. The St. Francois rarely exceeds one
hundred yards in breadth, its current is gentle, and its
navigation unimpeded.</p>

<p>We landed at a fine well opened farm on the right, a mile
below the mouth of St. Francois, where a handsome two
story cabin with a piazza, seemed to promise plenty and
comfort. This is the first settlement below the Chickasaw
Bluffs, a computed distance of sixty-five miles. It is owned
by one Philips from North Carolina, who has lived here six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>years.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Notwithstanding {271} favourable appearances,
we could obtain no kind of refreshments here, not even milk,
they having made cheese in the morning, so we rowed down
three miles and a half, to Wm. Basset’s delightful situation
on the Big Prairie, where was a large stock of cattle, yet
we were still disappointed in milk, so we kept on four miles
and a half to Anthony’s, where we obtained milk, sallad,
and eggs, and spent a pleasant night in a fine harbour, very
little troubled by musquitoes.</p>

<p>We had passed Well’s and Bell’s boats at moorings at
the Big Prairie, and about an hour after we stopped at
Anthony’s, the South Carolina and Pittsburgh boats arrived
and made fast a little above us.</p>

<p>The Big Prairie is a natural savanna of about sixty acres
open to the river on the right bank. It is covered with a
fine, rich, short herbage, very proper for sheep. Immediately
behind it at less than half a mile from the river, is a
small lake eight or nine miles in circumference, formed in
the spring and summer by the Mississippi, which in that
season rising, flows up a small canal or (in the language of
the country) bayau, and spreads itself over a low prairie.
As the river falls, the lake discharges its water again by
the bayau, and becomes a luxuriant meadow, covered with
a tall but nutritive and tender grass. While a lake, it
abounds in fish of every species natural to the Mississippi,
and when a meadow, it is capable of feeding innumerable
herds of cattle. It is then watered by a rivulet which
descends from some low hills about three miles to the
westward of the river bank. From its regular annual inundation,
this appears to be a fine situation for rice grounds,
if the water goes off soon enough to allow the rice to ripen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>There are two settlements joining to Anthony’s fronting
the river, and five or six others at some little distance behind,
there being in the whole about a dozen families between
Philips’s and a new settlement, {272} three miles below
Anthony’s, a distance of about twelve miles. The inhabitants
are all from Kentucky, except Basset, who is from
Natchez, and one family from Georgia. The soil here is
good and the situation pleasant and healthy. The settlers
have abundance of fine looking cattle, but they raise neither
grain nor cotton, except for their own consumption. They
would go largely into the latter, which succeeds here equal
to any other part of the United States, but they want machinery
to clean it, and none of them are sufficiently wealthy
to procure and erect a cotton gin.</p>

<p>From hence to Arkansas is seventy miles, the road crossing
White river at thirty-five.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> At the former (Arkansas)
is a good settlement of French, Americans, and Spaniards,
who before the cession to the United States, kept there a
small garrison, and on the banks of White river, some
wealthy settlers had fixed themselves, one of whom had
thirty negroes, but they were all forced off by general Wilkinson
a few years ago, as they had no titles from the United
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>States. This was bad policy, as the White river lands were
in such repute, that a great settlement would have been
formed there ere now.</p>

<p>May 31st, we proceeded in company with Bell and Wells,
and to the latter’s boats lashed ours, that we might drift
the faster, from his loaded boats drawing more water, and
being of course more commanded by the current than our
light one.</p>

<p>Seventeen miles below Anthony’s, the river banks begin
to be very low, generally overflowed; the islands also are
mostly willow islands, of which we passed several in forty
miles farther, which distance we floated down until sunset,
when we moored at a low point of willows, and were devoured
by musquitoes all night.</p>

<p>June 1st, after floating fourteen miles, and passing several
islands and sand bars, we passed the mouth {273} of White
river on the right, which appears more inconsiderable than
it actually is, by its mouth being almost concealed by willows.
Seven miles lower down we met a small barge with
seven hands rowing up; she had come down Arkansas river,
from the settlement of Arkansas, and was about returning by
the channel of White river, which communicates with the
Arkansas by a natural canal, so that we were puzzled to
understand the steersman, who said he was from Arkansas
and bound to Arkansas, until he explained it. Eleven miles
from hence, we had Arkansas river, two hundred yards
wide, on the right, and Ozark island two miles and a half
in front below, the Mississippi being about a mile wide.</p>

<p>The settlement of Arkansas or Ozark is about fifty miles
above the junction of that river with the Mississippi. It
consists chiefly of hunters and Indian traders, of course is a
poor place, as settlers of this description, never look for any
thing beyond the mere necessaries of life, except whiskey.
Had the White river settlement been fostered, instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>being broken up, Arkansas would have followed its example
in the cultivation of the lands, and would have become
very soon of considerable importance.</p>

<p>Having passed Ozark island (No. 75) two miles long,
on the right, we came to a mooring eight miles below, where
we had our usual torment of musquitoes all night.</p>

<p>June 2nd, we proceeded thirty-five miles, tired with the
perpetual sameness of low banks, willow islands and sand
bars, we then came to a settlement, the first below Big
Prairie, from whence it is one hundred and thirty-six miles,
and just fifteen leagues below Arkansas river.</p>

<p>This settlement was commenced two months ago by a
Mons. Malbrock, from Arkansas, who has a large family
and several negroes. He has named his place Ville Aussipot,
and he is clearing away {274} with spirit, having already
opened twelve or fourteen acres. His mode of providing
meal for his people, was by pounding corn in a wooden
mortar, with a wooden pestle, fixed to a spring sweep.</p>

<p>The neighbouring lands are all parcelled out and granted
to settlers, who are to commence directly. There is a fine
prairie a league inland. The river bank is sufficiently high
to be secure from inundation, being now six feet above the
surface of the water, and the soil is very fine.</p>

<p>We stopped for the night on the right bank, seven miles
below Mr. Malbrock’s.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="label">[195]</a> Arkansas Post (or Poste aux Arkansas) was accounted the oldest white
settlement in the lower Mississippi Valley. Tonty, on his voyage of relief in search
of La Salle (1686), ascended the Arkansas River to a village of a tribe by the same
name, where he left a detachment of six men headed by Couture. Thither, the
following year, came the survivors of La Salle’s ill-fated Texas colony, and related
the assassination of their leader. The post was maintained as a trading centre
and Jesuit mission throughout the French occupation, and survived an unexpected
attack by the Chickasaws in 1748. The Jesuits abandoned it as an unfruitful
field in 1763. During the Spanish occupation, the importance of this post as a
trading station increased. Pierre Laclède, founder of St. Louis, had a branch
warehouse at Arkansas Post, and died here in 1778. Upon the American occupation,
civil government was established (1804), and it was the capital for the territory
until 1820, when superseded by Little Rock. Arkansas Post was captured by the
Union forces from the Confederates, in 1863. It is now a small town about seventy-five
miles southeast of Little Rock.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>June 3d, after proceeding three miles, the river was narrowed
by a point of willows on the right to a quarter of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>mile wide, and five miles after, it widens gradually to half a
mile.</p>

<p>In the next nineteen miles we passed several islands,
giving a relief to the eye, by their variety and some fine
views.</p>

<p>We then passed on the right, the Grand lake, now grown
up with willows, where the river formerly entered, and encircled
a cotton tree island, which still rears itself predominant
over the surrounding willow marsh. Two miles below,
the old willow channel returns again, diagonally, to the
present river bank, on the opposite side of which, on the left,
the old channel seems to have been continued, there surrounding
{275} another clump of cotton trees, called Seary’s
island, (No. 90) which is about a mile long, and which
confines the present channel within a limit of a quarter of a
mile, which contraction shoots the river so strongly against
the low willow bend of the old channel below, that not being
able to bear the impetus of the torrent in the present flooded
state of the river, the tall willows are undermined, and falling
every moment, dash up the white foam in their fall, and
sometimes spring up again, as the root reaches the bottom
of the river, in such a manner as to impress the beholder
with astonishment.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles more brought us to island No. 92, where
we moored for the night. We found abundance of blackberries
on this island, but in gathering them, we were attacked
by such myriads of musquitoes, generated by a pond
in the middle, that we named it Musquitoe island.</p>

<p>June 4th, in eleven miles we arrived at Crow’s nest island,
where invited by the beauty of its appearance, some of us
landed in the skiff. It is a little narrow island, about a
hundred and fifty paces long by forty broad. It is sufficiently
raised above inundation, and is very dry and pleasant, with
innumerable blackbirds, which have their nests amongst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>the thirty tall cotton wood trees it contains. It is covered
with brush, through which is an old path from one end to
the other. A quantity of drift wood lies on its upper end,
which projecting, forms a fine boat harbour just below it,
quite out of the current. There are but few musquitoes on
the dry part, but a low, drowned point, covered with small
poplars, and extending a hundred yards at the lower end
swarms with them, and many of the largest size, called
gannipers. These venemous and troublesome insects remind
me of a humorous story I have heard, which I take the
liberty of introducing here.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen in South Carolina had dined together,
and while the wine circulated freely after dinner the conversation
turned on the quantity of musquitoes generated in
the rice swamps of that country. One of the gentlemen
said that those insects never troubled him, and that he
believed people in general complained more of them than
they had occasion to do—that for his part he would not
notice them, were he naked in a rice swamp. Another of
the company (according to the custom of the country, where
all arguments terminate in a wager) offered him a considerable
bet that he would not lie quietly on his face, naked,
in the swamp, a quarter of an hour. The other took him
up, and all the party immediately adjourned to the place
fixed on. The gentleman stripped, lay down, and bore with
the most resolute fortitude the attack of the hostile foe.
The time had almost expired, and his antagonist fearing he
must lose his wager, seized a fire brand from one of the
negro fires that happened to be near, and approaching slyly
applied it to a fleshy part of his prostrate adversary, who,
not able to bear the increased pain, clapped his hand on the
part, jumped up, and cried out “A ganniper by G——.”
He then acknowledged he had lost his wager, by that
“damned ganniper,” and the party returned to the house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>to renew their libations to Bacchus, and to laugh over the
comical termination of the bet.</p>

<p>Crow’s nest island is a beautiful little spot, and is about
a mile from the right bank, and half a mile from the left, and
only a mile below the commencement of a noble reach of the
river, which is perfectly straight for nine miles (therefore
called the Nine mile reach) in a S. S. W. direction, and upwards
of a mile wide.</p>

<p>Eighteen miles from the lower end of the Nine mile
reach, we came to three new settlements on the left, within
a mile of each other. The banks here {277} are not more
than three feet above the present level of the river. Eleven
miles farther, in an intricate pass between two islands captain
Wells’s inside boat was driven by the current against a
quantity of drift wood, the shock of which parted her from
his other boat and mine. She stuck fast, and we continued
down the sound between the islands about two miles, when
seeing a convenient place for stopping, we rowed in, and
made fast in a fine eddy, among willows at the lower point
of the right hand island, where we were soon after joined by
Wells with his boat which he had got off again without
damage.</p>

<p>Whiskey having been dealt liberally to the boatmen to
induce them to exert themselves while the boat was in danger,
it began to operate by the time they rejoined us, the
consequence of which was a battle royal, in which some of
the combatants attempted to gouge each other, but my boat’s
company interfering, separated them, and quelled the disturbance,
after which I delivered them a long lecture on
that shameful, unmanly, and inhuman practice, condemning
it in such strong terms, as to almost provoke an attack
against myself, but I at last succeeded, or thought I succeeded,
in making them ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>The two islands between which we had just floated, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>mentioned improperly in the Navigator as one island, which
is numbered 100. The channel between is very narrow, the
ship channel in this stage of the water being evidently to
the right of both, and a small willow island besides to the
right of them.—The second of the islands is properly No.
100.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The musquitoes were this night, as usual, insupportable,
spite of smoke which we used almost to suffocation.</p>

<p>{278} June 5th, having lashed the boats together again,
we cast them loose from their moorings at an early hour,
and trusted them to the current, but after floating six miles
we had to use our oars with the utmost exertion, to avoid some
broken and hanging trees, with a whirling eddy just below
them, occasioned by a point on the left projecting far into
a bend on the right, and being rendered rapid by the channel
above being narrowed by island 101. Inside of these broken
trees, the canes were burnt, as if with intention to make a
settlement. The canes or reeds, which grow to an immense
size on the river banks, had now began to take the place of
brush or copse wood, but they do not prevent the growth
of the forest trees, which appear to gain in size the lower
we descend.</p>

<p>A mile below the intricate pass, we came to a settlement
commenced this spring by a Mr. Campbell from Bayau
Pierre, who has made a good opening. The family which
had commenced near the whirlpool above, were residing with
him. The river in general at its greatest height never rises
more than a foot higher than it was now. It is ten miles
from hence to Yazoos river, and twenty to the Walnut hills,
eighteen below the last three new settlements, and one
hundred below Ville Aussipot.</p>

<p>A mile and a half lower, is a beautiful situation on the
right, partly cleared, with a cabin on it, but no inhabitants.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>The river trenches from hence E. S. E. and a mile lower is
another new settlement on the right, from whence is a fine
reach of the river downwards E. ½ S. In the next half
league, are three more new settlements also on the right, all
commenced this spring.</p>

<p>A mile lower is a charming situation for a settlement, at
present unoccupied. It is opposite island No. 103, and
continues three miles to a point where the river resumes
its S. S. W. direction, at the end {279} of that island, which
is itself a delightful and most eligible situation for an industrious
and tasty farmer.</p>

<p>There are some settlements opposite the end of the island
on the right bank, and on the left, opposite, is discernible
the bed of an old schute of the Mississippi, or rather a
mouth of the Yazoos, as the low willows which mark this
old bed join that river two miles above where it enters the
Mississippi. From my admiration of No. 103, my fellow
voyagers named it Cuming’s island, and indeed I should
have been tempted to have settled on it, had every thing
been perfectly convenient for that purpose.</p>

<p>A mile below Cuming’s island, is a settlement on the right,
and four others immediately below it, all within a quarter
of a mile of each other, and all apparently commenced last
year. Three miles below Cuming’s island, we passed the
mouth of the river Yazoos on the left. It is about two hundred
and fifty yards wide, and affords a fine view up it four
or five miles. Opposite, on the right, is the fine settlement
of George Collins, with the Walnut hills in sight over the
trees at the end of the reach. Three quarters of a mile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>below Collins’s there is another small settlement, from whence
the Mississippi takes a curve to the N. E. and then again
turns to the left, where at the end of a short easterly reach,
we saw over the trees, a cliff of the Walnut hills three miles
{280} lower down, and soon after, two large, well cleared
farms, cultivated from the bank to the top of the hills, where
are seen the earthen ramparts of Fort M’Henry, now abandoned.
These hills are about as high as the lower Chickasaw
Bluffs, but differ from them by rising gradually with a
gentle slope, having a most delightful effect on the eye after
the level banks with which it has been fatigued, since passing
the Bluffs.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Five miles below the hills, we lost sight of them, having
passed several new settlements on the right, but none on the
left below the hills for seven miles, where we observed a
good large framed house with a piazza. Two miles farther
we landed at a farm with a good negro quarter, belonging
to a Mr. Hicks from Tennessee, where we got some milk,
and returning to our boat, we boarded in the way the barge
Adventurer, twenty-nine days from New Orleans, bound to
Nashville.</p>

<p>There are a few new settlements in the next seven miles,
when on a point on the left we passed the first farm in
Palmyra, and rowing strong in to prevent being carried to
the right of Palmyra island, we stopped and moored at the
bank.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>
<p>It is about seven years since several families from New
England commenced this beautiful settlement. The situation
is almost a peninsula, formed by a continued bending
of the river in an extent of four miles, the whole of which
is cultivated in front, but the clearing extends back only one
hundred and fifty rods, where is a lake, and some low
swampy land, always inundated during the summer freshes.
There are sixteen families, who occupy each a front of only
forty rods, so that the settlement has the appearance of a
straggling village. The soil is very fertile, as a proof of
which, Mrs. Hubbard, to whose house I went for milk,
informed me that last year she had gathered seventeen
thousand pounds of cotton in {281} seed, from nine acres,
which, allowing it to lose about three quarters in cleaning,
left five hundred pounds of clean cotton to the acre, which
is a great excess of produce over the West India or Georgia
plantations, where an acre rarely yields more than two
hundred and seventy-five pounds. At this early season the
corn was well advanced, and I observed some in tassel.</p>

<p>Palmyra is one of the most beautiful settlements in the
Mississippi Territory, the inhabitants having used all that
neatness and industry so habitual to the New Englanders.
They now complain that they have too little land, and several
of them have appropriated more on the banks of a lake
about a mile behind the opposite bank of the Mississippi, in
Louisiana. I think the lake and swamp behind Palmyra
must render it unhealthy, and the pale sallow countenances
of the settlers, with their confession that they are annually
subject to fevers and agues, when the river begins to subside,
confirms me in my opinion. Indeed this remark
may be applied to the banks of the Mississippi in the whole
of its long course, between the conflux of the Ohio and the
Gulph of Mexico.</p>

<p>June 6th.-We proceeded this morning through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>channel between Palmyra and Palmyra island, which at
low water is almost dry.</p>

<p>The Mississippi has a westerly course past Palmyra, from
which it crooks gradually to the southward, and then to
the eastward, so that Point Pleasant in Louisiana, fifteen
miles by the river below Palmyra, is only two miles distant
by a road across the swamp from the opposite bank. There
are some islands in the river in that distance, but few settlements
on either bank, until we came to Point Pleasant,
from whence downwards the banks gradually become more
thickly inhabited.</p>

<p>{282} Let it be remarked that the river is generally from
half to three quarters of a mile wide, except in such parts
as I have particularized its breadth.</p>

<p>Big Black river, which is deep, but only forty yards wide
at its mouth, after a S. W. course from the Chickasaw
nation, discharges itself into the Mississippi on the left,
seven miles below Point Pleasant. There are several settlements
on the banks of Big Black, for forty miles above
its mouth, and a town was laid out on it which has not succeeded,
and on account of its unhealthy situation, probably
never will.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> A quarter of a mile below Big Black, a ridge
of hills called the Grand Gulph hills, terminates abruptly
at a bluff on the left bank. At the base of the bluff, are a
heap of loose rocks, near which is a quarry of close granite,
from which some industrious eastern emigrants have cut
some excellent mill and grindstones. These hills form a
barrier which turns the river suddenly from the eastern
course it had held for a few miles above, to a S. W. direction,
and it is at the same time narrowed by a projecting point
on the right, called Trent’s point, to about a quarter of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>mile wide. The acute angle and the sudden compression
of the waters of the river, form what is called the Grand
Gulph, immediately below the narrows, making two great
eddies, between which the true current runs in so narrow a
limit for about half a mile, that some skill and dexterity are
necessary to keep a boat in it, and to prevent her being
sucked into one or the other eddy, in which case, particularly
in that on the left, she will be carried round in a circle of a
mile or two, and require the greatest exertions of the oars
to extricate her. Delay is the only inconvenience attending
the getting engulphed, as there is no whirlpool of sufficient
suction to draw down even a skiff. Trent has a good house
and farm, and a most delightful situation on the right hand
point, which is as high above common inundation, {283} as
any other part of the river level banks, but the swamp
approaching close behind, contracts the farm more than a
proprietor would wish.</p>

<p>I may here observe that the banks of the Mississippi form
a natural dam, barrier or levée, more or less broad, from
fifty paces to three or four miles, behind which the land
slopes to nearly the level of the bed of the river, so that in
every summer flood, there is a general back inundation, on
the subsiding of which, so much stagnant water remains,
as to cause annual attacks of fever and ague, which accounts
for the sallow complexion of the inhabitants of the banks.</p>

<p>In the eight miles between the Grand Gulph and Bayau
Pierre, there are several settlements on the right, and but
three or four on the left bank of the river, the most conspicuous
of which is that of Major Davenport, began about a
year ago.</p>

<p>At three, P. M. having cast off from Mr. Wells’s boats,
we rowed into the mouth of Bayau Pierre, up which we
advanced a quarter of a mile, and then fastened to a willow,
in the middle of the river.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>
<p>The contrast between our situation now, and while in the
Mississippi was very striking. From a noble, majestick,
stream, with a rapid current, meandering past points, islands,
plantations and wildernesses, and bearing the produce of the
inland states, in innumerable craft of every kind, to New
Orleans and the ocean. To find myself suddenly in a deep,
dark, narrow stagnate piece of water, surrounded closely
by a forest of tall willows, poplars, and other demi aquatick
trees, and not a sound to be heard, except the monotonous
croakings of frogs, interrupted occasionally by the bull like
roaring of an alligator—the closeness of the woods excluding
every current of air, and hosts of musquitoes attacking
one in every {284} quarter. The <i>tout ensemble</i> was so
gloomy, that a British seaman, one of Wells’s boat’s crew,
who had volunteered to assist in getting our boat into the
bayau, looking round, exclaimed emphatically—</p>

<p>“And is it here you stop, and is this the country to which
so many poor ignorant devils remove, to make their fortunes?—D——n
my precious eyes if I would not rather
be at allowance of a mouldy biscuit a day, in any part of
Old England, or even New York, Pennsylvania, or Maryland,
than I would be obliged to live in such a country as
this two years, to own the finest cotton plantation, and the
greatest gang of negroes in the territory.”</p>

This territory, between 31° and 32° 30′ north latitude, was in contention between

the disputed strip. Meanwhile, the local authorities refused to surrender the forts,
and it was not until 1798 that a detachment of United States troops took possession
of Fort Nogales (built on this site in 1789), and changed its name to Fort McHenry,
in honor of the then secretary of war. This territory was part of the grant of the
Yazoo Company, whose frauds caused so much contention over titles in the district.

<p>On Monday 22d August, I set out from Bruinsbury on
horseback, for the purpose of visiting the most improved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>parts of the Mississippi territory, and the adjacent part of
the Spanish province of West Florida.</p>

<p>Bruinsbury was the property of judge Bruin,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> until lately,
that he sold it together with a claim to about three thousand
acres of the surrounding land to Messrs. Evans and Overaker
of Natchez, reserving to himself his house, offices and
garden.</p>

<p>It is a mile below the mouth of bayau Pierre, the banks
of which being low and swampy, and always annually
overflowed in the spring, he projected the {285} intended
town of Bruinsbury, where there was a tolerably high bank
and a good landing which has only been productive of a
cotton gin, a tavern, and an overseer’s house for Mr. Evan’s
plantation, exclusive of the judge’s own dwelling house,
and it will probably never now become a town notwithstanding
many town lots were purchased, as Mr. Evans
means to plant all the unappropriated lots, preferring the
produce in cotton to the produce in houses.</p>

<p>I was accompanied from the judge’s by an elderly Presbyterian
clergyman, a native of New England, who had
been a missionary among the Chickasaw or Cherokee
nations. He was a man of great simplicity of manners, and
wonderfully ignorant of all established modes. During
the short time we rode together, the characteristick feature
of his country was displayed in the innumerable questions
he asked me relative to whence I came, where I was going,
and my objects and intentions, particularly in my present journey.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>I at last discovered a mode of parrying his wearisome
curiosity, by becoming curious in my turn. This seemed
to gratify him equally, as it led to a circumstantial account
of a life as little chequered by incident as can be conceived.
He had been the scholar of the family, one of the sons of a
farmer’s family in New England being always selected
for that purpose. He had graduated at college—been
ordained—went to Carolina—kept a school there—was
appointed by a synod a missionary for the propagation of
the gospel among the Indians, in which situation for several
years, he had raised a family, and leaving his eldest children
to possess and cultivate lands granted him by the Indians,
he had removed with his wife and his youngest children to
this territory, where, by keeping a school, preaching alternate
Sundays, at two or three different places, twelve or fourteen
miles asunder, and cultivating a small cotton plantation, he
made a very comfortable subsistence. {286} Although I
could not agree with him with respect to the comfort of a
subsistence so hardly earned, yet I could not help admiring
the truth of the old adage, that <i>custom is second nature</i>, and
always fits the back to the burthen.</p>

<p>Our first two miles was through the river bottom, the
most remote part of which from the river, is inundated annually
by the back waters of bayau Pierre, which overflows
all the neighbouring low lands for forty miles from its
mouth, when its current is checked by the rising of the
Mississippi. On the subsiding of the floods, so much
water remains stagnant, as to cause the fever and ague to
be endemick in all the tract of country washed by the bayau
Pierre, from ten miles above the town of Port Gibson.</p>

<p>On leaving the swamp we ascended a hill, on the brow
of which is a charmingly situated plantation owned and
occupied by a Mr. Smith. The increased elasticity of the
air, renovated our spirits, and seemed to increase the good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>parson’s garrulity. A mile of a delightful road through
open woods on a dry ridge brought us from Mr. Smith’s,
to Mr. Robert Cochran’s fine plantation. It was near dinner
time, and a thunder cloud rising before us, gave my
companion a pretext for wishing to stop, but I having declared
before that I would not, and now refusing Mr. Cochran’s
invitation, who from the stile as we passed told us
dinner was on the table, the good man good humouredly
sacrificed his desire to mine, and proceeded with me, by
which complaisance he got wet to the skin. He only accompanied
me another mile, turning off to the left to go to
Greenville, while I continued my route to the southward
along the lower Natchez road, which runs nearly parallel
to the Mississippi, on the ridges behind the river bottoms.</p>

<p>A thunder cloud which had been threatening at a distance
for some time before, now began to rise and spread rapidly.
It was in vain that I put spurs to my {287} horse—I was
instantly deluged with torrents of rain, accompanied by as
tremendous thunder and lightning as I ever had before witnessed,
and a heavy gust of wind at the same time, blew down
several trees in every direction close round me. My horse
though an old steady traveller, was so affrighted that I could
not manage him but with great difficulty. Three miles and
a half through the storm brought me to Glascock’s small
plantation, where I fortified against a chill with a glass of
gin presented to me by the good lady of the house, who also
regaled me with some fine peaches. The rain soon subsiding,
I resumed my journey in my wet clothes, but I had
scarcely advanced a mile, when another shower forced me
to take shelter at a small, but pleasantly situated farm,
rented by a Mr. Hopper from Mr. Cochran.</p>

<p>The face of the country became now more broken, but
the soil improved, and the road degenerating to a bridle
path through the woods, and being hilly, and forked and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>intersected by cattle paths, was both difficult to find and
disagreeable to travel. A mile from Hopper’s, I stopped
at an old school-house, where I observed a shoemaker at
work under a shed in front of the cabin, to get my boot
mended. He was named Ostun, had lately arrived from
South Carolina with his family, and had made the unoccupied
school-house his temporary abode, until he should find
an eligible situation for a settlement. He repaired my
boot, entertained me with his intentions, hopes, and expectations,
regretted he had no shelter to offer me for myself
and my horse, that he might prevent my going farther that
night through the rain (which was literally the case, as the
old little cabin let the water in at almost every part) and
would accept of nothing for his trouble. It would be unpardonable
to neglect noticing the kindness of this plain,
honest shoemaker, in a country where benevolence is a virtue
not too much practised.</p>

<p>{288} A mile from hence, by the advice of my friendly
shoemaker, I turned to the left, to seek shelter for the night,
at the hospitable cabin and fine farm of Mr. James Norris,
half a mile farther, instead of keeping the usual road to the
right, two miles to Mr. Joseph Calvet’s.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> I was well recompensed
for my deviation, by a frank and hearty welcome, a
pleasant fire, a good supper, an excellent bed, and the intelligence
that I was on the best and plainest road, and the shortest
by four miles. This neighbourhood consists of half a
dozen families, chiefly from South Carolina, from which
state Mr. Norris came a few years ago. I found him fully
deserving the high character Mr. Ostun gave me of him for
hospitality. He strongly recommended my settling some
place near, and recommended it to me to purchase, if possible,
a tract of land owned by Mr. Cochran, near Hopper’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>August 23d, departing from Mr. Norris’s at early dawn,
the road, which had been opened wide enough for a wagon,
but now much overgrown by poke and other high weeds,
(the dew from which as I pressed through them, wet me
as much as a shower of rain would have done) led me along
the top of a narrow and very crooked ridge in generally a
S. E. direction nearly four miles, where coming to three
forks, I kept the left one which brought me in a mile more
through some beautiful open woods on a light soil to a small
corn field on the right, with no habitation visible, beyond
which I crossed up to my horse’s knees the North fork of
Cole’s creek, which now was a pretty little, transparent, sandy
bottomed stream, but after heavy rains it swells suddenly
and becomes a frightful and deep torrent, sometimes impassible
for several days. Turning to the left beyond the
creek, I had one mile to an old deserted field, now an arid
plain, affording a very scanty pasture of poor grass to a few
lean cattle. The distant crowing of a cock {289} advertised
me of my approach to a settlement, and I soon after came
to a corn field and a hatter’s shop, on the banks of the middle
fork of Cole’s creek, a stream in size and appearance similar
to the North fork. Crossing it, the road led through some
small plantations on a light thin sandy soil, a mile and a
half to Greenville, where I put up at Green’s tavern and
breakfasted. My host affected a little consequence, but
when he understood that I was in search of land to settle
on, he became more attentive, and persuaded me much, to
purchase from him, a tract of land in the neighbourhood,
which he recommended very highly.</p>

<p>Greenville (or Huntstown, its old name) the capital of
Jefferson county, is very handsomely situated, on a dry
sandy plain near the middle branch of Cole’s creek. It is
surrounded at a little distance by small farms and woods,
which add variety and beauty to its appearance. A stranger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>would suppose it healthy, but my information respecting
it was rather the reverse, particularly in the autumnal
months, when it is subject to bilious disorders. Perhaps
this may be owing to the excessive heat occasioned by the
reflection of the sun from the sandy soil, as it is sufficiently
elevated, and there is no stagnant pond, nor low marsh,
near it to generate fevers. This is probably one cause of its
being in a state of decay; another may be the difficulty of
approaching it during floods in Cole’s creek, which happen
after every rain, and which in a manner insulate it while
they last. It consists of one wide straight street nearly half
a mile long, running N. by W. and S. by E. intersected by
two small cross ones, containing in all forty tolerably good
houses, many of which are now unoccupied, and offered
for sale, at little more than a quarter of their cost in building.
It has a small church for general use of all christian
sects, a small court-house, a gaol and a pillory, a post-office,
two stores, two taverns, {290} and an apothecary’s
shop. The town is well watered by wells dug to about
thirty feet deep.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Proceeding to the S. S. W. keeping to the right at the
south end of the town, at one mile I crossed a deep ravine,
with a spring well and a washing camp in it, overhung by
a house on the projecting corner of a small plantation, on a
hill on the left.</p>

<p>The road was well opened, but hilly, through the woods,
for two miles farther, when on crossing a water course (now
dry) and rising a hill, I had a view on the right, over the
extensive plantation of colonel West,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> who has upwards of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>two hundred acres in one field in cultivation. The soil
seems very thin, as in the whole neighbourhood of Greenville,
but the crop of cotton and corn now looked luxuriant,
from the wetness of the season.</p>

<p>Two miles farther I passed on the right Parker Cardine’s
delightfully situated plantation, with an excellent dwelling
house, and good apple and peach orchards, with the south
branch of Cole’s creek, winding round on the right below,
and which I crossed soon after. The soil however is very
light, and is soon washed off, and worn out, where it has
been cultivated a few years, on the whole tract between
Greenville and Natchez.</p>

<p>The country here is well opened and inhabited to a little
beyond Uniontown, which is a small village of three or four
houses in decay, about a mile beyond Cardine’s.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>I stopped at Uniontown to <i>feed</i> my horse. (I make use of
the active verb <i>feed</i>, instead of the passive one, <i>to have
my horse fed</i>, as travellers in this country, who will not take
the trouble of giving corn and fodder to their horses themselves,
may expect to have them soon die of famine, although
they pay extravagantly for food and attendance.) I was
here joined by a trig looking young man mounted on a mule,
who requested to accompany me on the road towards Natchez.
{291} In riding along, he entertained me with his
history. He said his name was Jackson—that he was born
in London—was bred a painter, and was sent to a rich
uncle in St. Vincents, when only fourteen years old. That
aided by his uncle, he had traded among the West India
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>islands, until he was seventeen, when being concerned with
a son of colonel Haffey, in a contraband adventure to
Martinique, he lost every thing, and then came to the continent,
where he had supported himself as an itinerant house
and landscape painter, in which capacity he had travelled
over most parts of the United States. Unfortunately for
the credit of his veracity, he described my old friend colonel
Henry Haffey, as a native French Creole of Martinique,
when in reality, he was born in the North of Ireland, and
had nothing of the Frenchman, either in manner or character.
Besides, having no children himself, he had adopted
Henry Haffey Gums, a nephew of his wife’s. On this discovery
I humoured my companion, and affected to believe
all he said, which betrayed him into many laughable absurdities
and contradictions.</p>

</div>


<p>The road turning more to the S. W. led us through a
wood along a high ridge a little broken by hills, descending
abruptly on each hand at intervals, with only one small
settlement in the six miles to Sulserstown, which is a village
of ten small houses, {292} three of which are taverns. After
passing it, I observed to the N. W. an extensive cotton
plantation, with a good house in a very picturesque situation,
occasioned by an insulated hill near it, with a flat plain
on the top, cultivated in cotton, supported on every side
by a cliff, clothed with wood, rising abruptly from the cultivated
plantation below, which beyond the insulated hill,
was bounded by a range of broken higher hills, cultivated
to near the tops, and crowned with woods.</p>

<p>Six miles more brought us through a tolerably well inhabited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>country, to Washington, the capital of the territory,
where we stopped at Hill’s tavern.—This tavern (as I
find is the custom in this country) is kept in a front building
by Mr. Hill, assisted by some negro servants, while Mrs.
Hill and her daughters live in a detached building in the
rear, where I was received by them kindly, in remembrance
of their having descended the Ohio and Mississippi in my
boat with me.</p>

<p>Before supper I walked through the town, in which I
counted thirty scattering houses, including one store, one
apothecary’s shop, three taverns and a gaol, all in one street
on the Natchez road. The dress of some ladies I met in my
ramble was tasty and rather rich. Water is well supplied
by wells about forty feet deep, and about a quarter of a mile
from the east end is a delightful spring, near the bank of St.
Catherine’s creek, where is a hot and cold bath—the price
of bathing is three eighths of a dollar. Wine, liquors, and
spirits are sold—and I found three or four companies of
males and females, seated in the shade of some spreading
forest trees, enjoying the cool transparent water, either
pure or mixed to their taste. I was informed that this was a
fashionable resort of the neighbouring country, for several
miles round, and from Natchez, between which city {293}
and Washington a stage coach plies, arriving here every
evening and departing every morning.</p>

<p>Hearing a drum beat, on enquiry, I was informed, that it
was the evening roll call of three or four companies of foot,
at a barrack a little beyond the baths.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Governour Williams has a plantation adjoining the town,
and resides in a neat cottage upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>Wednesday 24th August.—After a sleepless night, I
arose early and found it raining, so I breakfasted, and
awaited until ten o’clock, when it clearing up a little, I
rode three miles in a southerly direction deviating a little
to the right of the main road, to a farm rented from Mr.
Forman by Mr. Blennerhasset, at whose hospitable dwelling,
I was received by Mr. B. and his accomplished and amiable
lady with the utmost kindness and politeness.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> I could not
help contrasting their present temporary residence in a decayed
cabin, with their splendid and tasty habitation on the
Ohio. Blest however in each other, with kindred souls and
similar tastes—possessing a noble library, and still a
sufficiency left after all their losses, with a well regulated
but liberal economy, for all the necessaries, and many of
the indulgencies of life.</p>

<p>After dinner I tore myself with difficulty from the social
and intellectual feast I was enjoying, and proceeding on my
journey through a woody country, and a light soil, I arrived
at Natchez a little before dark.</p>

<p>I was much struck with the similarity of Natchez to many
of the smaller West India towns, particularly St. Johns
Antigua, though not near so large as it. The houses all
with balconies and piazzas—some merchants’ stores—several
little shops kept by free mulattoes, and French
and Spanish Creoles—the great mixture of colour of the
people in the streets, and many other circumstances, with
the aid of a little fancy to heighten the illusion, might have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>made one {294} suppose, in the spirit of the Arabian Knight’s
Entertainments, that by some magick power, I had been
suddenly transported to one of those scenes of my youthful
wanderings. When the illusion was almost formed, a
company of Indians meeting me in the street dispelled it,
so bidding adieu to the romance of the fancy, I sat down
to supper at Mickie’s tavern, or hotel, by which appellation
it is dignified.</p>

<p>On Thursday the 25th, I arose early, and sauntered to
the market-house on a common in front of the town, where
meat, fish and vegetables were sold by a motley mixture of
Americans, French and Spanish creoles, Mulattoes and
negroes. There seemed to be a sufficiency of necessaries for
so small a town, and the price of butcher’s meat, and fish
was reasonable, while vegetables, milk and butter were
extravagantly dear.</p>

<p>Natchez, in latitude 31° 33′ N.—longitude 91° 29′ W. of
Greenwich, contains between eighty and one hundred dwelling
houses, as nearly as I could enumerate them. It is situated
on a very broken and hilly ground, but notwithstanding
the irregularity and inequality of the surface, the streets are
marked out at right angles, which makes them almost impassible
in bad weather, except Market street and Front
street which are levelled as much as the ground will permit.
A small plain of a hundred and fifty yards wide in front of
the town rising gradually to the edge of the high cliff or bluff
which overhangs the river, veils the view of that interesting
object from the inhabitants, but at the same time contributes
to defend the town from the noxious vapours generated in the
swamps immediately on the river banks, yet not so effectually
as to prevent its being sometimes subject to fevers and
agues, especially from July to October inclusive, when few
strangers escape a seasoning, as it is called, which frequently
proves mortal. The surrounding country at a little distance
{295} from the Mississippi, is as healthy as most other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>countries in the same parallel of latitude. The landing,
where are a few houses immediately under the bluff, is particularly
fatal to the crews of the Ohio and Kentucky boats,
who happen to be delayed there during the sickly season.</p>

<p>Though Natchez is dignified with the name of a city,
it is nevertheless but a small town. It is however a place of
considerable importance in consequence of its being the
principal emporium of the commerce of the territory, and
of its having been so long the seat of government, under
the French, English, and Spaniards, which caused all the
lands in the vicinity to be cultivated and settled, while
those more remote were neglected, though in general a
much better soil. There is a Roman Catholick church,
which is an old wooden building in decay, and there is a
brick meeting-house for either Presbyterians or Anabaptists,
I am not sure which. These, and an old hotel de ville, or
court-house, are the only publick buildings the city boasts,
except it be an old hospital, now fitting up as a theatre for a
private dramatick society. Several of the houses are new
and very good, mostly of wood, and I am informed many
(more than half) have been added within the last four or
five years. Fort Penmure,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> on the edge of the bluff is now
in ruins, but the situation, and the extent of the old ramparts,
prove it to have been a post of considerable consequence.
It effectually commands the river, without being
commanded itself, and the view from it is very extensive,
particularly over the flat swamps of Louisiana, on the opposite
side of the Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>The first permanent settlement on the Mississippi was
made in 1712, and notwithstanding many misfortunes,
particularly the failure of the celebrated Mississippi company,
founded by John {296} Law, during the regency of
the duke of Orleans, the settlements extended in 1727 to
Natchez, and a fort was erected there. In 1731, the Indians,
disgusted with the tyranny and cruelty of the French
colonists, massacred most of them, for which, in the following
year, the French took ample vengeance, almost extirpating
the whole Natchez race. The few who escaped took
refuge amongst their neighbours the Choctaws, where becoming
naturalized, they soon lost their original name.
The French kept possession of the country until 1763, when
it was ceded to the British. It continued under the British
government until 1779, when it was surrendered by colonel
Dickson the commander of the British troops at Baton
Rouge, to the Spaniards under Don Bernando de Galvez.
In 1798, in consequence of arrangements between the United
States and the government of Spain, the latter gave up all
claim to the country east of the Mississippi to the northward
of the 31st degree of north latitude, in favour of the former,
who erected it into a territorial government, under the name
of the Mississippi territory.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the southward from Natchez, I passed
some tasty cottages, and deviating a little to the right of the
main road, in two short miles I came to colonel (late governour)
Sergeant’s handsome brick house.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The road led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>through a double swinging gate into a spacious lawn, which
the colonel has formed in the rear of the house, the chief
ornament of which was a fine flock of sheep. The appearance
of this plantation bespoke more taste and convenience
than I had yet observed in the territory. Riding half a mile
through the lawn, I left it by a similar gate to the first, and
a quarter of a mile more of an open wood brought me to
colonel Wm. Scott’s, to whom I had a letter of introduction.</p>

<p>{297} He received me according to his usual custom with
kindness and hospitality, and presented me to his lady
and to governour Williams, with whom he had been sitting
at breakfast. I was invited to join the breakfast party,
and I spent an hour very agreeably. The colonel had been
a captain in the United States’ army under general Wayne,
and on his arrival in this country, he married a lively, genteel
French woman with a handsome fortune. He quitted the
army, and joining the militia, he is now adjutant general
of the territory. He is a fine, dashing, spirited and friendly
Irishman, and has only to be known to be esteemed.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>I forbear mentioning my opinion of the governour, as the
curse of party pervades this territory, as well as every other
part of the United States, and any opinion of a publick
character, would not fail to offend one or the other party.</p>

<p>After resisting a pressing invitation to prolong my visit,
I proceeded on my journey, passing several fine and well
cultivated plantations, the most conspicuous of which were
Mr. Burling’s, Sir Wm. Dunbar’s, Mr. Poindexter’s and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>Mr. Abner Green’s.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> I had now come twelve miles, and
it being excessively hot, I stopped at Mr. Green’s to request
some fodder for my horse, to which Mr. Green obligingly
added an invitation to dinner to myself. After dinner, Mr.
Green invited me to look at his garden, which was very
spacious, and well stocked with useful vegetables, and understanding
that I had been in the West Indian islands, he
made me observe some ginger in a thriving state, and the
cullaloo or Indian kail, also some very fine plants of Guinea
grass, which he proposes propagating. There was some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>Guinea corn, and another kind of corn with a similar stalk
and blades, but bearing its seed in a large close knob, at
the extreme top of the stalk. That beautiful shrub the
pomegranate, which, though scarce, seems natural {298} to
this soil and climate, was in great perfection, and several
beds were occupied by very fine strawberry plants, which
are also scarce in this country.</p>

under General Knox throughout the Revolution. Shortly after he became interested
in the Ohio Company of Associates, and in 1786 was appointed surveyor
therefor. Upon the organization of Northwest Territory (1787), Sargent was appointed
secretary, and continued in this office until chosen governor of the newly-organized
Territory of Mississippi (1798). Sargent was a man of ability, a scholar,
and a poet; but being a Federalist and of New England austerity, he was unpopular

<p><a id="Footnote_209" href="#FNanchor_209" class="label">[209]</a> These were among the most prominent of early Mississippians.</p>

<p>Sir William Dunbar was a Scotchman, who came to America because of failing
health, and embarked in the Indian trade at Fort Pitt in 1771. Two years later
he removed to West Florida, and shortly after settled at Natchez. Under the Spanish
régime he was chief surveyor, and in 1797 boundary commissioner for that
power. He was appointed judge of the first territorial court in 1798. Dunbar
was a successful planter, and had the first screw-press for cotton, in Mississippi.
He also had scientific attainments, and was a member of the American Philosophical
Society. He died in 1810, leaving many descendants.</p>

<p>Abner Green belonged to one of the most prominent Mississippi families. He
was brother of Colonel Thomas Green, first territorial delegate; his father was a
Virginian who came to Natchez under the Spanish régime, and was influential in
having Georgia assert its authority over this territory. Abner Green was register
of probates under the Bourbon County, Georgia, act, and treasurer-general for the
territory in 1801. He married a daughter of Colonel Anthony Hutchins, and was
regarded as a model planter.</p>

<p>George Poindexter, one of the most able of Mississippi politicians, was regarded
by his enemies as one of the most unscrupulous. A native of Virginia, he came to
Mississippi in 1802. His first public office was that of attorney-general for the
territory, as such conducting the prosecution of Aaron Burr. Having killed
Abijah Hunt, a political enemy, in a duel, he was nevertheless exonerated by being
chosen one of the territorial judges, which office he conducted with fairness and
ability. In the War of 1812-15, he served as aide to Jackson at New Orleans, and
became one of the general’s warm partisans, defending him in Congress in 1819.
Poindexter was a member of the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1817, and
the first representative in Congress for the new state (1818-20). Upon his return
home, he was elected governor of the State after a campaign of great personal bitterness,
but was defeated in an attempt to secure a second term. In 1830, Poindexter
again entered politics, being chosen United States senator, in which position he
attacked Jackson with as much spirit as he had formerly defended him. Jackson
even accused Poindexter of having instigated an attempt upon his life, but afterwards
was convinced of his error. Poindexter retired from public life in 1835,
but for twenty years longer continued a career of dissipation and excess.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Leaving Mr. Green’s, I soon after past Mrs. Hutchins’s
on the left, in whose cotton field, at some distance from the
road I observed an Indian mound or barrow, similar to those
which one so often meets with in the vicinity of the Ohio,
and of which I have been informed great numbers are in
this country. Mrs. Hutchins is the widow of a col. Hutchins,
who was a half-pay British officer, had considerable landed
property, was very hospitable, and had great influence in
the political business of the territory, which by the manner
he used it, acquired him the character of an ambitious
monarchist.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>This and all the neighbouring plantations are called the
Second creek settlement from a rivulet of that name which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>flows from the eastward towards the Mississippi. The soil
is much superiour to that near Natchez, and the farms are
generally the best improved in the territory. I observed
a very handsome coach under a shed near Mrs. Hutchins’s
cottage, which was the only one I had seen in this country.</p>

<p>The road led from hence southerly through pleasant
open woods, with very few plantations in sight, {299} eight
miles, to Greaton’s tavern on the right bank of the Homochito.
After putting up my horse, I joined Mr. Greaton in
fishing, he providing me with a rod and line—I was unsuccessful,
but he caught some delicate cat-fish, and four
fine carp, about a pound and a half each. A thunder
shower interrupting our sport, we returned to the house,
supped on our fish, coffee, and bread and butter, and retired
for the night.</p>

<p>The Homochito is a beautiful little river of clear water,
and a sandy bottom, here about fifty yards wide. It falls
into the Mississippi ten or twelve miles from hence, on its
banks ten miles higher up, is a fine thriving settlement,
called the Jersey settlement, from the inhabitants having
generally emigrated from that state; and 10 miles still higher
or more north easterly, the lake road from Orleans to
Natchez crosses it.</p>

<p>Friday 26th, I was ferried across the Homochito by an
old Spaniard, in a flat which he hauled over by a rope leading
through two rollers fixed on the gunwale. I found the
country hilly, but the road was pleasant, and the soil rich,
though thinly inhabited. I had eight miles to Mrs. Crosby’s,
a remarkably fat widow, who keeps a tavern and receives
the toll of a bridge over Buffaloe creek, which is a deep,
slow and muddy little river, joining the Mississippi, six or
seven miles from hence, through a long and extensive swamp.
My fat landlady made breakfast for me, while my horse
was feeding, after which I pursued my way to the left of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>the swamp, mounting into a hilly country, covered with a
thick cane brake, through which a wagon road is cut in a
S. W. direction eleven miles, without settlement, house or
water, in all that distance, so that it is both fatiguing and
dreary.</p>

<p>I emerged from the hills and canes over a small creek,
at a fine plantation of a Mr. Percy. My horse being fatigued,
I stopped to request a little {300} fodder for him, which was
accorded with a very ill grace by the overseer, the proprietor
residing at Washington. And here I will remark that the
overseers of plantations in this whole territory, are for the
most part a rough, unpolished, uncouth class of people,
which perhaps proceeds from their being made use of
literally as negro drivers, to keep those unfortunate wretches
to their work in the field, and to correct them for all real
or supposed offences.—They do this with their own hands,
and not as in the sugar colonies, by one of the slaves themselves,
appointed for that purpose and called the driver.
This renders them callous to every thing like sentiment or
feeling, and gives them a roughness and abruptness in
their manners, which is extremely disagreeable and disgusting.</p>

<p>A good road with a ridge of hills called Loftus’s heights
on the left, and the swamp which commenced at Buffaloe
creek on the right, leads from hence to Fort Adams in a distance
of six miles, there being a few plantations on both
sides of the road, those on the right joining the swamp, and
the left hand ones being on the broken land beyond the
cliffs and hills.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Fort Adams or Wilkinsonburg is a poor little village of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>dozen houses, most of them in decay, hemmed in between
the heights and the river. The fort from whence it derives
its first name, is situated on a bluff overhanging the river,
at the extremity of the ridge of Loftus’s heights. It is about
one hundred feet above the ordinary level of the Mississippi,
which is not more than three hundred yards wide here, so
that the fort completely commands it, with several small
brass cannon and two small brass howitzers mounted “en
barbette.” The fort which is faced with brick, has only a
level superficies large enough for one bastion, with a small
barrack inside, the {301} whole of which is commanded by a
block-house a hundred and fifty feet higher, on the sharp
peak of a very steep hill, which in time of war might serve as a
look out, as well as a post, as it commands a most extensive
view over the surrounding wilderness of forest, as well as the
meanders of the river for several miles.</p>

<p>The ridge of hills near Natchez, bounds the prospect to
the northward, but there is nothing for the eye to rest on,
not even a plantation to be seen, as they are all veiled by
the surrounding forests, the gloom of which is heightened
by the idea, that a principal portion of the vast tract in
sight, is nothing but an unwholesome swamp, which will
cost thousands of lives before it can ever be made habitable,
or fit for cultivation. This is experienced in a great degree
at Fort Adams, which on account of its insalubrity, is
deserted by its garrison, a subaltern with a platoon being
left in it, to guard the pass, and prevent smuggling—while
the garrison inhabits a pleasant cantonment in the hills
towards Pinckneyville, about five miles distant. A path
descends gradually from the block-house to the town, along
a very narrow ridge, about the middle of which is the burying
place of the garrison, the graves of the officers being conspicuous
by head stones with the name, rank, and time of
decease. Two or three are interred here who have been shot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>in duels, to which barbarous custom they are much addicted
in the American army.</p>

<p>There are two gun boats moored a little above the fort,
which, with the long view up the river, and the flat country
on the opposite bank put me in mind of the river Shannon
at Tarbet in Ireland; to which however it is far inferiour
in breadth as well as in magnificence, and variety of scenery.
The unhealthiness of its scite is probably the reason that
{302} Wilkinsonburg does not prosper, notwithstanding it
is the capital of a county, and is a post town.</p>

<p>I put up at Marsalis’s tavern, where my old and esteemed
friend, doctor H——, lodged. I found him confined by a
severe attack of the dysentery, which however did not
prevent his giving me a cordial and a joyous welcome.
Notwithstanding the poverty of the place, Marsalis gave
us a tolerably good supper, according to the custom of the
country, of coffee, bread and butter, sliced bacon, and a
fine dish of gaspar-goo, the best fish I had yet tasted of the
produce of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Saturday, 27th—My horse being foundered, doctor H——
accommodated me with another very good one, and after
breakfast I proceeded on a good road to the south-eastward,
over the most broken and hilly country I had yet seen in the
territory, it leading sometimes along the brink of some high
and steep precipices, but is kept in good order by the troops
encamped in the neighbourhood. At four miles I kept
to the left towards Pinckneyville, instead of turning to the
right to the camp, at a mile’s distance, as I intended to
visit it on my return. I passed two small plantations near
the forks of the road, they being the only ones between
Wilkinsonburg and Mr. Carey’s, which was three miles
farther, the country becoming gradually less broken.</p>

<p>Mr. Carey, to whom I had a letter from H——, received
me with cordial hospitality, but there was nothing strange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>in that, he being a native of Erin, that country so noted for
this now unfashionable virtue.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>{303} After dinner I went half a mile farther to Capt.
Robert Semple’s, brother to my friend Steele Semple, Esq.
of Pittsburgh. He was formerly a captain in the United
States’ army, and is now owner of a very fine plantation,
where he resides, living in a style of well regulated, gentlemanly
taste and liberality.—From him and his amiable
lady I experienced a most friendly reception, and remaining
with them until next morning (Sunday, 28th) I proceeded
on my route, going back to Mr. Carey’s. Keeping his
plantation on the left, two miles S. S. E. brought me to
Pinckneyville. On arriving at Mr. Carey’s yesterday, I
had got out of the broken hilly country, and I was now in
one of alternate plains and gently sloping hills affording fine
situations for plantations, mostly occupied.</p>

<p>Pinckneyville is a straggling village of ten houses, mostly
in decay, and some of them uninhabited. It is situated
on a pleasant sloping plain, and the surrounding country
is comparatively well cultivated. It has a little church, a
tavern, a store and a post-office.</p>

<p>A mile and a half farther, in a S. E. direction, the road
crossed the demarkation line, which divides {304} the Mississippi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>territory from the Spanish province of West Florida,
at the first house from Pinckneyville, and the last subject
to the United States. The line runs along the parallel of
the 31st degree of north latitude. It was cut forty
feet wide, but it is now scarcely perceptible, from the rapid
growth of trees and shrubs, in the short space of seven
or eight years since it was opened, under the direction of
Mr. Ellicot, commissioner on the part of the United States,
and major Minor on the part of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>I was now in the district of New Feliciana, in the Spanish
province of West Florida. A wagon road through a
naturally fine country, with some small plantations at distances
from half a mile to a mile, brought me in eight miles
to Don Juan O’Connor’s. This respectable old gentleman,
to whom I carried a letter of introduction, has a fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>estate, and is building a very large and commodious house,
which, when finished, he intends for the residence of his
family now in Philadelphia. He is held in great estimation
by the government, and throughout the country, where he
many years exercised the office of Alcalde, or chief magistrate
of the district; but resigning it on account of his increasing
age, he has been succeeded by his neighbour,
Capt. Robert Percy, formerly of the British navy, a gentleman
perfectly well qualified to execute the office with becoming
dignity and propriety.</p>

<p>I remained three days with Mr. O’Connor, at his friendly
solicitation, visited by, and visiting the neighbouring gentry
of this rich and hospitable country, during which time a
laughable incident happened.</p>

<p>Accompanying Mr. O’Connor to Capt. Percy’s, a distance
of only two miles, through the lands of the two gentlemen,
Mr. O’C. conducted me through the woods by a
bridle path, instead of keeping the main road, for the purpose
of seeing some of his people, who were sawing timber.
After riding in different {305} directions for some time
without finding them, he at last gave up the attempt, saying
we would now take a path which would soon bring us into
the road. The sun being overcast, the old gentleman soon
lost his direction in a labyrinth of cattle paths, by which
we got involved sometimes in a thick cane brake, and
sometimes in a copse of briars. I saw he was astray, but
without seeming to perceive it, I followed him, chattering
on indifferent subjects. At last despair of extricating us
conquering his shame of acknowledging himself lost in his
own woods—he suddenly exclaimed, “Where is your
pocket compass?”—I answered that accompanying him
so short a distance on his own ground, I had not thought it
necessary to bring it. “You should always carry it in this
country,” exclaimed he, a little pettishly. “What course
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>do you wish to go?” said I—“N. E.” replied he, “ought
to bring us into the main road.”—“Well,” said I,
“let us leave the mossy side of the trees on our left
shoulder.”</p>

<p>Following my advice, we soon heard some one at a distance
singing loudly. We took the direction of the voice,
and soon afterwards found the wagon road, after wandering
above two hours in search of it. Mr. O’Connor’s relating
the story good humouredly at Capt. Percy’s did not prevent
his being rallied a good deal about it, and it spreading,
became a standing subject of laugh against him, among
his surrounding friends. The day after this, as I was
accompanying Mr. O’C. and some of his neighbours to a
militia muster, my horse took fright, at my suddenly raising
my umbrella during a shower, and plunging violently, he
threw me on my head, but without doing me any other injury
than dirtying me all over.</p>

<p>On Thursday, 1st September, I left Mr. O’Connor’s after
breakfast, with the intention of pursuing my journey, but
calling at Capt. Percy’s, he said it was his birth day, and
that I must spend it with him, {306} and that he had sent
for Mr. O’C. for the same purpose.</p>

<p>This was truly an agreeable day to me, it being devoted
to social converse without ceremony, while the well regulated
and liberal domestick arrangements of the amiable and well
informed lady of our friendly host, recalled to my mind
the elegant refinement I had so often enjoyed in the society
of her fair countrywomen, during my residence in Scotland.
To her engaging native manners, Mrs. Percy adds
the advantages of a long residence in London, where she
seems to have grafted on her native stock, such exotick
knowledge only, as could farther expand a mind, already
adorned both by nature and art.</p>

<p>Next day, Friday, 2d September, my worthy host and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>hostess, after exacting a promise from me, that I should make
their house my family’s home, until fully provided in one
myself, should I choose that part of the country for my
future place of residence, accompanied me on my way,
fording Bayau Sarah, which is about thirty yards wide, to
the plantation of Mr. Sweezey, a mile distant, where a child
being dangerously ill of a fever, Mrs. Percy had for several
days before, and even nights, aided the disconsolate mother
in the duties of nursing, while her humane and friendly
husband prescribed and dispensed the necessary medicine
in the absence of the physician—none living nearer than
six or eight miles. Indeed he adds the gratuitous practice
of physician and apothecary to the office of chief magistrate,
and he is equally useful in each department to the surrounding
country, while his amiable lady performs the part of a
real Lady Bountiful, with judgement and true benevolence.</p>

<p>Capt. Percy rode with me about five miles farther, to shew
me a tract of land he had in his disposal, on which he wished
me to settle, and another, the property of Mr. Cochran of
Bayau Pierre, which had {307} been offered for sale. He
then bade me adieu, and I went on alone, passing Mr.
Sterling’s and doctor Bruin’s, and proceeding to the southward
four miles farther, I arrived and stopped at doctor
Flowers’s.</p>

<p>The doctor was absent, but Mrs. Flowers did the honours
of her house to me, with the most pleasing attention, and he
returning home in the evening confirmed the kind welcome
I had received, and to which I was in no other way entitled
than, in addition to my being a stranger (which about
Bayau Sarah seems to be a general passport to hospitality)
I had a letter of introduction from my valuable and respected
friend, judge Bruin, whose name, where he is known, opens
every door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>
<p>The next two days were spent chiefly at doctor Flowers’s,
and in riding about the neighbouring country, during which
I visited Mr. William Barrow, who has a very handsome
house, a noble plantation of about four hundred acres of
cotton all in one field, and a hundred and fifty negroes. I
also accompanied the doctor to pay my compliments to
Don Thomas Estevan, lately appointed commandant of
New Feliciana, with full powers to act for the governour.
He received me very politely, and appeared to be a man of
pleasing manners, and good general information, although
I was informed that he had risen from the rank of a private
in the army, to his present situation. That, however, is a
very common thing in the Spanish service, where merit
is sure of being rewarded, without the aid of money or
great connexions, notwithstanding the character for pride
which that nation is taxed with.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>On Monday, the 5th September, I proceeded on my
tour, crossing Alexander’s creek, an inconsiderable stream,
and having a good road to the eastward, through a forest
abounding with that beautiful and majestick evergreen, the
magnolia or American laurel, six or seven miles to Mr.
Perrie’s. He was {308} absent until supper time, previous
to which I amused myself with walking about his fine plantation,
and the best garden I had yet seen in this country.
A letter from doctor Flowers insured me a friendly reception,
and I passed the night here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Perrie is a native of Fifeshire in Scotland, was a millwright,
by which profession, aided by an advantageous
matrimonial connexion, he now possesses a hundred negroes,
and is alcalde of the quarter—yet he would gladly remove
to the land of his nativity, if he could do it conveniently.</p>

<p>Tuesday 6th, a good road through open woods brought
me in six miles to Doyle’s, from whence, fording Thompson’s
creek, (a fine little river sixty yards wide) I stopped at
Horton’s tavern, on the opposite side. Mr. Murdoch, the
proprietor, from whom Horton rents the house and adjoining
plantation, but who reserves a room for himself, having
seen me at Mr. O’Connor’s, politely asked me to stay
breakfast, after which I proceeded.</p>

<p>All the tract of country from Pinckneyville to near Thompson’s
creek, being watered by Bayau Sarah, or some of its
tributary streams, is most generally known by the name of
the Bayau Sarah settlements, and is part in the United
States and part in the Spanish territory. It is esteemed as
the finest soil, the best cultivated, and inhabited by the
most wealthy settlers, of any part of the Mississippi territory
or West Florida, but the land appeared to be liable to have
its soil washed away, so as to lose it entirely in a few years
after clearing it, on all the declivities. It is on the whole
however, a charming country.</p>

<p>My road now led through a thick wood, much impeded
by copse and briers, and it being a dead flat, the whole
of it was a complete slough, in some places deep enough to
mire my horse to the saddle skirts for several hundred yards
together, so that I made slow progress, for the first six miles,
in an easterly {309} direction, which had been the course of
the road from doctor Flowers’s.</p>

<p>I met a man on foot, of a very suspicious appearance,
labouring through the mire. He was a stout active fellow,
very ragged, and his face disfigured by a large scar across his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>mouth. I passed him however peaceably, and soon after
leaving a Mr. Carter’s plantation on the right, I entered
the most beautiful plain I had seen in this country. It was a
savanna or prairie, about six miles long, and from half a
mile to a mile wide, skirted by woods, and a few plantations,
and abounding with clumps of oak, ash, mulberry, poplar
and other indigenous trees, affording between them beautiful
vistas of various character, while large herds of cattle
and horses appeared here and there, to enliven the scene,
which had additional interest from two men galloping after
and noosing some wild horses.</p>

<p>I stopped and dined at the house of Richard Dewal, esq.
on the plain. Mr. Dewal is an Englishman, and alcalde
of the quarter. He was absent, but Mrs. Dewal received
me with politeness and hospitality.</p>

<p>Leaving the plain, the road soon became as bad as possible,
to be capable of being travelled. Three and a half miles
of it brought me to Droghen’s plantation in a wretched
solitude, from whence I had five miles farther of equally bad
road, without an inhabitant to Fridges, a Scotchman. In
the next three miles I passed three plantations, and then
came to the bank of the Mississippi at Mrs. O’Brien’s very
pleasantly situated farm, from whence is a view down the
river past Montesano to Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>A mile farther, parallel to the river bank, brought me to
Montesano. This has been lately laid out for a town by
Mr. Wm. Herreis from London, who is the proprietor, but
I do not think he will succeed in his plan, as the country
around is not sufficiently inhabited to support a town, and
besides it is too near {310} to Baton Rouge, the seat of government,
of the western division of West Florida. There is some
prospect of his succeeding better in a saw and grist mill he
is erecting, which is to be wrought by steam. It is on a
large scale, and a vast deal of money has already been laid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>out on it (I have been informed, upwards of thirty thousand
dollars) yet it does not seem to be in great forwardness.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>It is called only four miles from hence to Baton Rouge,
but the badness of the road made me think it eight, perhaps
six may be the true distance. I passed some small neglected
French plantations on the left on the summit of a range of
low hills, which extend from Montesano, while on the right
I had a swamp, out of which the cypress has been cut,
between me and the river, the road being very bad, through
a natural savanna of coarse grass, intersected by deep
ravines, and miry sloughs.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213" class="label">[213]</a> Andrew Ellicott was an American engineer of note. Born in Pennsylvania
(1754) of Quaker ancestry, he passed his early life in Maryland, devoting himself
especially to mathematical studies. In Baltimore and Philadelphia he became a
friend of Washington and Franklin; and at their suggestion was employed to define
the boundary between Virginia and Pennsylvania, and later that between New
York and Pennsylvania. In 1792, he was appointed surveyor-general of the
United States. He also assisted in laying out the national capital. While acting
as commissioner for adjusting the southern boundary of the United States with
Spain, according to the treaty of 1795, Ellicott encountered serious diplomatic
difficulties, and alienated a party of the English inhabitants of the Natchez district.
Claiborne’s animadversions, however, in his <i>Mississippi</i>, seem hardly
borne out by the facts. In 1808, Ellicott was appointed secretary of the Pennsylvania
land-office; and four years later, professor of mathematics at West Point,
where he died in 1820. His journal during his employment in the Southwest, is
valuable as a record of conditions in that region.</p>

<p>Stephen Minor was a Pennsylvanian by birth, educated at Princeton, and early
came west to explore the new country. At St. Louis he was persuaded to convey
some dispatches to the governor-general of Louisiana at New Orleans, who, fancying
the frank but politic young American, offered him a position in the Spanish army.
Minor served the Spaniards with address and fidelity. Taking no advantage of
his position, he remained loyal to Spain, at the same time becoming popular with
the English-speaking inhabitants of the Natchez district, where he was stationed.
He was finally promoted to the governorship of Natchez, which he retained until
its surrender to the United States (1798), when he became an American citizen, and
died at Concord, Mississippi.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_214" href="#FNanchor_214" class="label">[214]</a> The province of West Florida was settled during the British occupation
(1764-83), and its population was of the same character as that of Mississippi, to
the north of it—chiefly American colonists with an admixture of English, Irish,
and Scotch emigrants. Feliciana was not erected into a Louisiana parish until
1811, but under the Spanish régime was made a district subordinate to the Baton
Rouge province. In 1810 the inhabitants threw off the yoke of Spain, and declared
themselves annexed to Louisiana.</p>

<p>William Barrow came to West Florida about 1795, entered land under a Spanish
grant, and developed a fine plantation. His descendants have been prominent

improved steam power by Oliver Evans, of Philadelphia which costs for a thirty
horse power about three thousand dollars. It is said that a Mr. Cohoon, of the

<p>Arriving at Baton Rouge, on enquiry I was informed that
Madame Le Gendre’s was the {311} most respectable
auberge, I accordingly stopt there, and found a number
of genteel men, Frenchmen, Spaniards, English and Americans,
with about a dozen of whom I sat down to supper,
quite <i>a la Française</i>. The table was well covered with
different made dishes, and a variety of vegetables, among
which the most conspicuous, was a large dish of gumbo,
served by the hostess at the head, which seemed to be a
standing dish, and much in repute, as almost every one was
helped to it. It is made by boiling ocroc until it is tender,
and seasoning it with a little bit of fat bacon. It then becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>so ropy and slimy as to make it difficult with either knife,
spoon or fork, to carry it to the mouth, without the plate
and mouth being connected by a long string, so that it is a
most awkward dish to a stranger, who besides, seldom
relishes it, but it is a standing dish among the French creoles,
as much as soup and bouilli is in France, or the <i>olla</i> in
Spain.</p>

<p>A bed was prepared for me in the front gallery or piazza,
where Madame Le Gendre assured me I should be less
troubled with musquitoes than in the interior of the house,
and that I should also find it more cool and agreeable. I
mention this as a <i>trait</i> of French character, particularly
the female, to make a virtue of necessity, and to turn even
their inconveniences to advantage, for notwithstanding her
assertion that it was solely <i>pour l’accommodation de Mons.
l’Etranger</i>, had there been any other place for a bed in her
small house, one would not have been prepared for me in
the gallery. The musquitoes were sufficiently ennuyants to
make me rejoice at perceiving the first dawn of day, when I
hurried on my clothes, and sallied out to view the seat of
government of the western division of West Florida.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>About half a dozen tolerably good frame (or wooden)
houses scattered on an extensive plain surrounded on three
sides by woods at a little distance, first {312} made their appearance,
while a dirty little town of 60 cabins crouded together
in a narrow street on the river bank, penned in between
the Mississippi and a low steep hill descending from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>the plain, filled up the fourth side. I walked through the
village—it is a right French one—almost every other
house being a petty shop for the sale of bread, tobacco,
pumpkins and taffia (or bad rum) distilled at the sugar
plantations a little lower down the river. It is matter
of astonishment how so many shops of the same kind find
customers. I observed two tolerably well assorted stores,
one kept by a Frenchman, the other by Mr. Egan, an
Irishman, to whom I carried an introductory letter from Mr.
O’Connor, which ensured me a friendly and hospitable
welcome.</p>

<p>I breakfasted with him, and then went to view the fort
on the plain above the north end of the town. It is a regular
square with four small bastions at the angles. The ramparts
are composed of earth thrown up out of a small dry
ditch or fosse which surrounds it, and are crowned by a
stoccade of pickets. A few small guns mounted, point to
the different approaches, and also command the river, but
it is a work of very little strength, and not capable of much
defence against a prepared enemy.</p>

<p>I returned to my friend Egan’s, who accompanied me to
the house of Don Gilbert Leonard, the contador (or collector)
to whom I had letters of introduction. The affectation
of importance which this gentleman attached to his
offer of accompanying me to government house, as soon
as his <i>excellency the governour</i> should be visible, was matter
of amusement to me, who had been accustomed to see less
ceremony observed in introductions to men of infinitely
greater importance. He excused himself from asking me
to dine with him, as he said his family were all indisposed,
but any other time that I should be in Baton Rouge, he
hoped to have that pleasure. He promised {313} to call
on me about eleven o’clock at Mr. Egan’s, as soon as he
had made himself up for a visit to the governour, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>begged leave to retire to dress, although the changing of a
silk morning or dressing gown for a coat, was all that was
necessary, he having evidently bestowed some time on his
person just before our arrival.</p>

<p>During the short time we remained at his house, Don
Gilbert led the discourse to the politicks of the day, reprobating
in most warm terms, the folly of the Spaniards for
endeavouring to emancipate themselves from the chains of
Napoleon—ascribing it to their being instigated to it by
the artifices of that enemy of mankind <i>Britain</i>, to which
country he declared himself a sworn enemy. It is worthy
of remark, that all this opinionated and ill informed self
consequence, proceeded from a son of Irish parents, who
had arisen to his present station in a Spanish provincial
government, from an obscure situation in life, by a chain
of fortuitous circumstances. As he had volunteered himself
to be my Ciceroni to the governour, I awaited him at
Mr. Egan’s some time later than the appointed hour, which
tardiness was of course to give the visit additional consequence.
We at last proceeded together, and not finding the
governour at home, I told him, I would put him to no
farther trouble, but would myself wait upon his excellency
on his return from his promenade.—He made his bow, and
I was again a free man.</p>

<p>About one o’clock, I found the governour, Don Carlos de
Grand Pré at home. He gave me a polite reception, and
while his written permission to remain six months in the
country (a ceremony all strangers are obliged to go through,
previous to making a permanent settlement) was preparing,
he entered into a conversation on agricultural topicks, and
appeared to be a well informed, and well bred man. He
avoided touching on politicks, but Don Gilbert’s sentiments
on {314} that subject are supposed to be his, he being a
native of France, and of course naturally partial to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>country, whether ruled by a Capet, by a mob, or by a
Napoleon.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>After a friendly and unceremonious dinner with Mr. Egan,
I left Baton Rouge on my return, not having any curiosity
to explore any more of the country than I had hitherto seen,
the cream of which I considered to be the Bayau Sarah settlements.</p>

<p>Returning again through Montesano, I arrived at Mrs.
O’Brien’s a little before dark. It being too late to proceed
any farther that night, I stopped and requested room for
myself and horse until morning. My request was complied
with according to the general custom of the country, but in
such polite terms, and it introduced me to so agreeable a
society at supper, that I congratulated myself for not having
had time to go farther. The family consisted of Mrs.
O’Brien herself, and her daughters Mrs. Flood, wife of
doctor Flood of New Orleans, Mrs. Saunders, and Miss
O’Brien. Two gentlemen from Orleans joined us after
supper, which was an additional motive for self-congratulation.
As they were travelling my road. They as well as
me were strangers to Mrs. O’B.</p>

<p>It is impossible to travel in any part of this new country
after dark, as the roads are only bridle paths, which are so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>darkened by the woods through which they lead, that the
adventurous traveller must inevitably lose himself.</p>

<p>On Thursday, 8th September, I proceeded with my two
companions before the family were stirring, and we arrived
at Mr. Duwal’s on the Great Prairie, time enough to sit
down with the family to breakfast. We afterwards stopped
to bait at Mr. Carters, and then went on cross Thompson’s
creek to Mr. Perry’s, where we found Messrs. Duncan and
Gamble, lawyers from New Orleans, at dinner. Chairs
were placed for us of course, and after partaking of Mr.
Perry’s hospitable {315} meal, I went on to doctor Flowers’s—separating
from my companions, who had each different
friends to visit in that part of the country.</p>

<p>Next day, the 9th September, I went to Capt. Percy’s
to dinner, and spent the remainder of that day and night
there, and on the 10th, after dining at Mr. O’Connor’s I
retraced my journey across the line into the Mississippi
Territory, and passing through Pinckneyville, I entered
Capt. Semple’s plantation, and rode nearly two miles through
it before I came to the house of the proprietor—passing
in the way two different negro quarters, and the whole
road resembling several I have known through the demesnes
of the nobility in Europe, in its variety—through woods,
lawns, pastures and cultivated fields, on the whole the most
beautiful plantation to ride through of any I had hitherto
seen in this western country.</p>

<p>I had to regret the absence of my hospitable host and
hostess, who were on a visit at Mrs. Trumbull’s, Mrs.
Semple’s mother. I was however well taken care of—and
proceeding next morning, I deviated a little from the road
to visit the camp. As I approached it I met several negroes
returning home from a market which is kept there every
Sunday morning. On my arrival I was much surprised
with a village, differing from any I had ever before seen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>Twenty-four large huts faced a wide open space cleared
for a parade, in front of which is held the market. In the
rear of these, with a narrow street between, are ten very
snug and well furnished cottages, appropriated for the
officers, who reside in them, some with their families, and
some <i>en garçon</i>. But the most remarkable circumstance is
that the whole camp is constructed with cane (the large
reed) in such a manner as to render every dwelling perfectly
tight and warm. They are all floored with plank, and the
officers’ quarters are glazed, and have each a little {316}
garden; and there runs through the whole an air of neatness,
propriety, and cleanliness, that I have seldom seen surpassed.
The situation is on the slope of a very high hill, and the
whole country for some miles round, particularly towards
the Mississippi, is nothing but a continuation of steep and
broken hills, covered with forest timber, and an impenetrable
cane brake, except in a few places, where some adventurous
settler has found a small spot, not too steep for
the plough, or where narrow paths of communication have
been cut through the canes.</p>

<p>Having gratified my curiosity with a view of this little
encampment, I went on to Wilkinsonburg, and spent the
rest of the day with my friend H——.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 12th September, proceeding at early
dawn, I took a wrong trace about five miles from Fort
Adams, by which I was taken two or three miles out of my
road, but coming to a plantation, I had some compensation
made me for my <i>egarement</i>, by receiving directions for
another road to Buffaloe creek, by which I cut off five
miles, with the additional satisfaction of having only eight
miles without a house, instead of twelve by the main road.
I had hills on my right hand, covered with the usual variety
of forest trees, and a thick cane brake underneath, while on
my left, a gloomy and malignant swamp extended to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>Mississippi, some miles distant. I breakfasted at Smith’s
who keeps a tavern, and a ferry over Buffaloe creek, three
miles below the toll bridge on the other road. I had three
short miles of a bad and miry road to Ellis’s plantation, and
four from thence along a ridge to major Davis’s, where I
again came into the main road. A mile farther brought
me to Big Jude’s, a free negro woman, settled on one side
of a broken plain, which seems to have been a plantation
at some distant period back, but by the washing away of
the soil, it now only affords nourishment to a short herbage,
{317} seemingly very proper for sheep. From hence is a
very extensive view over the surrounding forests—in which
far to the westward may be seen a line formed by the Mississippi,
making a great curve that way. Ellis’s heights
and the chain of hills running from thence to the eastward
of Natchez terminate the view to the northward, while
Loftus’s heights do the same to the southward. Extensive
prospects occur so rarely in this country of forests, that when
a traveller happens to meet with one, he feels wonderfully
cheered, although he sees nothing but a horizon of woods,
which, particularly when without their leaf, in the winter
season, have a very sombre and gloomy appearance, a little
inequality of horizon where a hill happens to bound the
view, being the only variety; but after emerging from the
thick forests and cane brakes, in which he has been long
buried, he feels an expansion of the whole system which
is extremely pleasing.</p>

<p>The road is hilly but good, through a pleasant wood,
chiefly of that superb tree the magnolia or American laurel,
clear of underwood and cane, and passing several small
plantations four or five miles from Jude’s to the Homochito.</p>

<p>Being ferried across that charming little river, I had a
good road through a pleasant country tolerably well settled
five miles to Mr. Tomlinson’s. I had a letter to him from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>my friend H——, which was no sooner delivered, than both
he and Mrs. T. vied with each other in their friendly attentions
to me. They insisted on my not going farther that
night, and manifested the greatest friendship for the writer
of my introductory letter, by the warmth and kindness of
their hospitality to me.</p>

a tall cypress tree, which, having been stripped by the lightning to its red wood,
formed a prominent landmark. The town was first settled by the French about
1720, but remained an inconsiderable hamlet, even after the accession of eighty
Acadians (about 1730). The British, while in control of West Florida, built a fort
and established a garrison here, which was surrendered by Colonel Dickson to the
victorious Spanish under Galvez, in 1779. Baton Rouge was incorporated as
an American town in 1817, and became the capital of Louisiana in 1850.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_217" href="#FNanchor_217" class="label">[217]</a> Don Carlos de Grandpré was a Frenchman, who held important positions
in the Spanish service. In 1779, he aided Galvez in his capture of British Florida,
and was left by the latter in command of the fort at Baton Rouge. In 1788, he
commanded the Natchez district, but made himself unpopular to the American
inhabitants, whereupon he was superseded by Gayoso de Lemos. Upon the latter’s
promotion to the governorship of Louisiana, Grandpré was again detailed for
Natchez; but on account of the protests of the inhabitants, was removed in favor of
Minor. When Louisiana was transferred to the United States, Grandpré was
commandant at Baton Rouge. The American inhabitants of this district began a
revolt, which Grandpré severely repressed. Upon the successful revolt of the same
province in 1810, a son of the commandant was killed while defending the post of
Baton Rouge. During the British advance against New Orleans, Grandpré sided
with his former enemies, and boarded one of their warships. His later history
is unknown.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

&amp;c.</p>
</div>


<p>On Tuesday, 13th September, I set out early, after returning
thanks to my kind host and hostess. At two miles
I passed Mrs. Hutchinson’s on the right; one mile farther,
Mr. Abner Green’s on the left; three quarters of a mile
beyond which, I left Mr. Poindexter’s, member of congress
from this territory, on the right.</p>

<p>I stopped for a few minutes at Mr. Dunbar’s—sometimes
known and addressed by the title of Sir William
Dunbar, I know not on what foundation. He is a native
of Scotland—is a gentleman of literature and philosophical
research—is esteemed rich—and occupies one of the
most tasty and best furnished cottages I have seen in the
territory.</p>

<p>Passing three or four other large plantations in sight
of the road, six miles more brought me to St. Catharine’s
creek, now an inconsiderable brook, but in floods an impassable
torrent; crossing which I had two miles and a half
to Col. William Scott’s, where I stopped and dined with
Mrs. Scott, the Col. being from home.</p>

<p>After dinner, taking the road through Natchez, I went
to Mr. Blennerhasset’s, where I supped and slept.</p>

<p>Wednesday, 14th, after breakfast, Mr. Blennerhasset
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>accompanied me to Natchez, where we made a few visits,
in doing which we called on Mr. Evans, whose niece, Mrs.
Wallace, a young and gay widow, and his eldest daughter,
favoured us with a few tunes on an organ, built for him by
one Hurdis, an English musical instrument maker and
teacher of musick, {319} then residing in Natchez. The
instrument was tolerably good, and ought to be so, as it has
cost one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>I returned home with Mr. Blennerhasset, and next morning
very early, proceeded through Washington, Sulserstown
and Uniontown to Greenville, and from thence by a tolerably
good road, in a northerly direction, twelve miles to
Trimble’s tavern, where I put up for the night. I was
much impeded in my progress for the last two miles, by the
effects of a hurricane, which had happened about a year
before, and which had blown down by the roots, or broken
off the tops of all the trees in its way—levelling every
cabin and fence that opposed its passage, but like the generality
of the hurricanes (which happen frequently in this
climate and always from the westward) not exceeding half
a mile in breadth. Trimble’s family had like to have been
buried under the ruins of their cabin, not having had over
a minute to escape to the outside, and throw themselves
flat on the ground, when it was blown down. Those gusts
are very tremendous, being always accompanied by thunder,
lightning, and torrents of rain, but from running in such
narrow veins, they are very partial, and therefore not so
much dreaded as those general ones which sometimes
devastate the West India islands.</p>

<p>Next day I proceeded nine miles in a northerly direction
to Port Gibson, on a western branch of the Bayau Pierre.
This little town of twenty houses is the capital of Claiborne
county, and is esteemed the most thriving place in the territory,
notwithstanding it is extremely unhealthy, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>proximity of some stagnant ponds, and the annual inundation
of the Mississippi, which swells Bayau Pierre and
causes it to stagnate for from four to six months, every
year. The ponds might be drained, were the inhabitants
not so entirely occupied by business and {320} pleasure, to
which two pursuits they devote the whole of their time.</p>

<p>It is thirty miles from Port Gibson to the Mississippi,
following the windings of the Bayau Pierre, through a very
hilly and broken country, but it is only fourteen miles by the
road. As when the waters are up the bayau is navigable
for large craft, that season is the most bustling time in Port
Gibson, the storekeepers then importing goods and exporting
cotton. On the subsiding of the waters, the sickly
season commences, and lasts with little variation from
July to October, inclusive. This is more or less the case
over the whole territory, particularly on the banks of the
Mississippi, and in the neighbourhood of swamps and
stagnant ponds. The driest seasons are the most unhealthy.
The prevailing malady is a fever of the intermittent species,
sometimes accompanied by ague, and sometimes not. It is
rarely fatal in itself, but its consequences are dreadful, as
it frequently lasts five or six months in defiance of medicine,
and leaves the patient in so relaxed and debilitated a state,
that he never after regains the strength he had lost. It also
frequently terminates in jaundice or dropsy, which sometimes
prove fatal.</p>

<p>All newcomers are subject to what is called a seasoning,
after which, though they may be annually attacked by this
scourge of the climate, it rarely confines them longer than a
few days. Every house in Port Gibson is either a store, a
tavern, or the workshop of a mechanick. There is a very
mean gaol, and an equally bad court-house, though both are
much in use, particularly the latter, as, like the United States
in general, the people are fond of litigation. Gambling is carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>to the greatest excess, particularly horse racing, cards
and betting—a wager always deciding every difference of
opinion. On the whole, Port Gibson and its neighbourhood
is {321} perhaps the most dissolute as well as the most
thriving part of the territory.</p>

<p>I dined at my friend doctor Cummin’s,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> who lives on
his fine plantation near the town, and taking a S. W. road of
thirteen miles, I arrived in the evening at Bruinsburg.</p>

<p>I shall here conclude my tour, with a few general observations.</p>

<p>The climate of this territory is very unequal, between
excess of heat during the principal part of the year, when
the inhabitants are devoured by musquitoes, gnats and sand-flies,
to excess of cold, in the winter nights and mornings,
when a good fire, and plenty of warm woollen clothing are
indispensibly necessary, though the middle of the day is
frequently warm enough for muslin and nankeen dresses to
suffice.</p>

<p>The soil is as various as the climate. The river bottoms
generally, and some of the cane brake hills, not being exceeded
for richness in the world, while some ridges and
tracts of country after being cleared and cultivated for a
few years, are so exhausted, as to become almost barren.</p>

<p>Water is very partially distributed—it being scarce,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>unpleasant, and unwholesome, within seven or eight miles
of the Mississippi—and it being fine and in abundance
from that to the eastward to the pine woods, which generally
begin at from fifteen to twenty miles distance from the
river.</p>

<p>The face of the country is also much diversified—a dead
swampy but very rich level borders the Mississippi the
whole length of the territory and West Florida, from the
Walnut hills to Baton Rouge, with the exception of some
ends of ridges, or bluffs as they are called, at the Walnut
hills, the Grand and Petit gulphs—Natchez and Baton
Rouge. The flat or bottom is in general about two miles
broad, though in some places nine or ten. The different
water courses, {322} which run mostly into the Mississippi
from the eastward have each their bottom lands of various
breadths, but all comparatively much narrower than those
of the Mississippi. The intervals are composed of chains
of steep, high and broken hills, some cultivated, some covered
with a thick cane brake, and forest trees of various
descriptions, and others with beautiful open woods devoid
of underwood. Some are evergreen with laurel and holly,
and some, where the oak, walnut and poplar are the most
predominant; being wholly brown in the winter, at which
season others again are mixed, and at the fall of the leaf
display a variety of colouring, green, brown, yellow and red.</p>

<p>On approaching the pine woods, the fertility of the soil
ceases, but the climate becomes much more salubrious—that
will however never draw inhabitants to it while a foot
of cane brake land or river bottom remains to be settled.</p>

<p>The pine woods form a barrier between the Choctaw
nation and the inhabitants of the Mississippi territory,
which however does not prevent the Indians from bringing
their squaws every fall and winter to aid in gathering in the
cotton crop, for which they are paid in blankets, stroud, (a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>blue cloth used by them for clothing) handkerchiefs, and
worsted binding of various colours, besides other articles of
manufactured goods, which are charged to them at most
exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>The cotton crop requiring constant attention, and children
being useful in gathering it, the bulk of the inhabitants
cannot afford to spare the labour of their children, so that
education is almost totally neglected, and perhaps there are
few people, a degree above the savage, more completely
destitute of literary acquirements. But as they grow up,
they can find time for attendance at courts of law, horse
races, and festive, or rather bacchanalian meetings at taverns,
where bad whiskey is drank to the greatest excess.
Notwithstanding {323} this proneness to dissipation, to the
neglect of manners, morals and property, there is a semblance
of religion, so that any noisy sectarian preacher may
always be sure of having a congregation, if his time of
preaching is known a day beforehand.</p>

<p>With respect to the productions of the territory, cotton is
the staple, and since the disappearance of specie it serves
in lieu of money. The river bottom lands generally yield
from eighteen hundred to two thousand pounds to the acre,
the uplands about a thousand. Maize or Indian corn is
produced on new land in the ratio of seventy or eighty
bushels per acre, well attended. Horses, horned cattle,
hogs and poultry might be raised in any quantity, yet cotton
so entirely engrosses the planters, that they are obliged to
Kentucky for their principal supply of horses and pork and
bacon.</p>

<p>Wheat would grow well, but it is not attended to, so that
all the wheat flour used, comes down the Mississippi. The
middle states supply a quantity of salted beef, and the
southern ones rice, which might also be raised abundantly.</p>

<p>When not destroyed by a frost in April, there are abundance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>of early apples and peaches; but the climate is too
cold in winter for the orange or lemon to the northward of
La Fourche, on the Mississippi, below Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>The woods abound with bear and deer, which are sometimes
killed and sold by the Indian and white hunters.
Wild turkeys on the hills, and water fowl of every description
in the swamps are abundant, besides smaller game
both four footed and feathered of various descriptions.
But the chase, either with dogs or the gun is so laborious
an occupation, from the difficulty of getting through the
cane brakes and underwood, that one seldom meets with
game at the tables of the planters.</p>

<p>{324} The Mississippi, the smaller water courses, the
lakes and ponds abound with cat-fish of a superiour quality,
and a variety of much more delicate and finer fish, yet one
seldom meets with them, any more than with game.</p>

<p>In short, the tables of all classes of people have as little
variety to boast of as those of any other civilized people in
the world. Coffee, although double the price that it is
bought for at New Orleans, is by custom become an article
of the first necessity, which the wife of the poorest planter
cannot do without, and it is of course the most common
breakfast. Milk is used to excess, which I have reason to
think is an additional cause of the prevalence of bilious
disorders.</p>

<p>Proper care and conduct, might in some degree correct
or guard against the effects of the climate, and prudence
and a well regulated economy, might procure to the inhabitants
of the Mississippi territory, almost every comfort,
convenience and delicacy, enjoyed in the most favoured
countries upon earth.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_218" href="#FNanchor_218" class="label">[218]</a> Dr. John Cummins was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in
1780. Having studied medicine with Dr. Rush of Philadelphia, he emigrated to
Mississippi Territory to engage in the practice of his profession, settling first at
Port Gibson; later having married a daughter of Judge Bruin (1804) he removed
to the plantation on Bayou Pierre, where Cuming visited him. He endorsed
heavily for Burr and Blennerhassett, losing by them about $65,000. Burr’s maps
left in his care are important evidence of the destination of his expedition. Dr.
Cummins was called to Richmond in order to testify at the Burr trial, and afterwards
attempted to recover some of the money he had lost, but with no success.
Removing to the parish of Concordia, Louisiana, he lived the life of a wealthy
cultivated planter—being especially interested in literature—until his death
in 1822. The details of his history have been kindly furnished by his granddaughter,
Mrs. T. C. Wordin, of Bridgeport, Connecticut.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>February 9. This evening we made a good landing on
the Spanish shore, with the river even with the top of the
bank. When we had got our boat tied to a tree, I took a
walk on the shore, and found it covered with herbs, briers,
blackberries and oak trees, all in leaf. I measured the leaf
of a sycamore tree and it was twenty inches over. The
evening was calm and clear, but the air rather cool, the new
moon looked beautiful.</p>

<p>Feb. 10. We proceeded early and got ten miles before
sunrise. At half past one o’clock we came to a part of the
river where some little time before there had been a hurricane;
it overspread an extent of about half a mile in breadth,
and crossed the river in two places about one league apart.
The tops of the trees had been twisted off, others torn up by
the roots and hurled into the river, some lying with their
roots above the bank, and their tops in the river. The
route it had taken was clearly perceptible, and how far it
extended on each hand. Its appearance was like the wreck
of creation, or the subsiding of some general deluge. Over
this whole extent there was not the least vestige of a tree
left, the deserted stumps excepted. At four o’clock, after
taking a circuitous {326} route in a very long bend of the
river, the vestiges of this hurricane again appeared. It had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>taken a north east course, spreading destruction in its train;
even the elastick cane brakes were torn up and extirpated.</p>

<p>Feb. 11. At half past seven arrived at the mouth of the
Yazoo river. It has a beautiful appearance, rising in the
mountains of Georgia, and taking a south west course, empties
itself here. Our expectations were now raised on seeing
once more the dwellings of men, having floated <i>six hundred
miles</i> through savage nations, without seeing a dwelling of
civilized people, and were not a little pleased with discovering
over the tops of the trees at a remote distance the Walnut
hills, upon which is a garrison and some dwellings of United
States’ citizens. When opposite the garrison the flag was
hoisted as a token for us to bring too, which we obeyed.
Mr. M—’s boat was a mile ahead, but was labouring hard
to make the shore, knowing the necessity of coming too,
he landed, but was obliged to let loose again, and left us
to offer an apology to the commandant. All along the
bank we saw numbers of Indians of the Choctaw nation,
men, women, and children, decorated with beads, broaches,
deer tails, buffaloe horns, &amp;c. We had no sooner landed
than the whole garrison was in an uproar, making preparations
to fire upon Mr. M—’s boat.</p>

<p>The sergeant came down to inform us of the intention of
the garrison. Mr. E—, the owner of the boat in which I
was, replied that that boat was his property, and the garrison
saw the endeavours of the men to land, but without
effect, that he was ready to give the necessary information
respecting her and cargo, and if any damage was done, he
knew where to apply for redress; this spirited reply quieted
the mind of the sergeant, and the storm of the garrison subsided.
We tarried here a few hours, sold some {327} apples,
cider, &amp;c. and then dropped down about four miles where
we landed.</p>

<p>Feb. 12. Two hours before sunrise we resumed our voyage,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>overtook two other boats for Natchez, met a large keel
boat rowing up with twenty oars working, and the men were
singing and shouting at a wonderful rate, I suppose the
effect of their morning dram, being informed each man gets
three every day.</p>

<p>At 12, we took our canoe and got a quantity of neat Bamboo
canes, which we spent the day in trimming. At 5,
after passing the mouth of Bayau Pierre, we entered the
Grand Gulph, a place formed by a large bluff or high land
on the east shore, and a short point of land on the opposite
side. The river here is very much contracted, on each
hand there are prodigious whirlpools, between which the
current runs.</p>

<p>Feb. 13. The country is now a little more agreeable,
being partly settled, nor are we in danger from sawyers, they
being chiefly swept away by the large rafts of timber taken
down every season to Natchez and Orleans, for the purpose
of building, &amp;c. The banks of the river are now lined with
that beautiful species of cane called fan pernato, or lettania,
the stem is of an oval form, and when twisted, makes a
handsome walking stick (some of which we got), its top is
formed like a fan, and is used for that purpose by some,
when dried and bound. Peach trees in blossom were scattered
along the banks. Half past 5, we came in sight of
Natchez, a town situated on a high hill, about a quarter of
a mile from the river. This is in the territory of the United
States; here is a garrison, the country round is rich and
fertile, thickly inhabited, the climate favourable for producing
Indian corn, figs, indigo, cotton, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Feb. 14. I walked up into town after breakfast, found
it contained about one hundred houses, and {328} beautifully
situated, the inhabitants however are much incommoded
for the want of water in the summer; staple commodity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>cotton, which when separated from the seed and packed
in bags, fetches twenty dollars per 100 lbs. There are fig
trees in every garden, the ground covered with perpetual
green, except when burnt up in the summer by the heat of
the sun. There is a beautiful Roman chapel, and a formidable
garrison about a quarter of a mile below the town.
The hills were every where covered with wild pepper grass,
which furnishes the town with excellent sallad. Within
a few miles I am told improved plantations may be purchased
at from two to ten dollars per acre, and unimproved
lands at 50 cents. The head quarters being removed from
Natchez to Loftus’s heights, fifty miles lower down the
river, we concluded to loose our hold and drop down to
that place, which we reached about two o’clock next day,
but were not able to make a landing until two miles below
the garrison. We collected our papers, and with difficulty
from the badness of the route up the bank, we reached head
quarters, and inquired of the centinel for the general (Wilkinson.)
After waiting a few minutes the general came out
of his tent; recognizing us, and after a few compliments, he
insisted on our walking in and dining with him, which we
accepted. We found him surrounded by his officers, after
introducing us to them, he ordered each of us a chair, one
on his right hand and the other on his left, he made some
inquiry about our Pittsburgh friends, conversed on politicks,
theology, &amp;c. and observed that the soldiers were full of
money, having just been paid off, and if we had been so
fortunate as to have landed at the camp, we might have
made great sales. After taking a few glasses of wine I
requested to speak to the general in private. Having informed
him of my business, and shewed him my documents,
&amp;c. I requested him to oblige me with a {329} letter
of introduction to the governour at New Orleans, which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>promised he would have ready the next morning. On
taking leave of the general for the evening, he ordered a
periogue to convey us down to our boat where we arrived in
safety.</p>

<p>Feb. 16. The general’s barge came down for some apples,
cider, and onions, in it we returned to the camp and dined
with doctor C——, and went with him to the general’s, who
received us politely, and who furnished me with a letter to
the Orleans governour as he had promised, together with
the papers I left in his hands. I took my leave and returned
to the boat.</p>

<p>Feb. 17. Having the general’s periogue still with us,
Mr. E. and four others rowed her up to the camp, and got
his business settled with the captain. This and yesterday
had been wet and disagreeable.</p>

<p>Feb. 18. At 4, A. M. we left Loftus’ heights camp,
with an encrease of two passengers for New Orleans. Half
past nine, we passed the mouth of Red river, which comes in
from the Spanish shore, and which is almost full of alligators.
We floated during the night about sixty miles, and on</p>

<p>Feb. 19. We entered the settled parts of the banks of
the Mississippi. At 7, we met two large periogues from
New Orleans. The men called to us in French, and asked
where we were from, we answered from Pittsburgh. The
country here is generally low and flat, and all along the
banks are beautiful plantations. The river is here and for
one hundred and fifty miles above New Orleans, kept within
its bounds by artificial banks raised sufficiently high for this
purpose, called the <i>levee</i>, a step very necessary, as the country
on either side is lower than the surface of the river.
These banks were raised at an enormous expense by order
of the Spanish government. At 2, we crossed the mouth of
Bayau Sara river, two miles from which resides a Mr. {330}
Bradford [since dead] greatly celebrated in the late western
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>insurrection, in Pennsylvania.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> A little above this river,
on the opposite shore, is a Roman church, at a settlement
known by the name of Point Coupée, which signifies a
point cut off.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> At half past three we proceeded with
difficulty, owing to high winds, and getting a little alarmed
we made shore. Half past six, P. M. we came to the head
of two islands both of which stood athwart our way; they
are the more remarkable being the last in the Mississippi,
except below New Orleans. Between these islands the
navigation is dangerous, but a safe and good passage for
boats or vessels of any burden may be had on either side.
During the night we floated a considerable way, but were
driven by the wind to the eastern shore. Our canoe getting
entangled in the limbs of a tree, we lost it.</p>

<p>Feb. 20. At 5, A. M. we got imperceptibly into an eddy,
and were detained in it about an hour. We were now
much amused with the many beautiful plantations which
covered the banks on both sides of the river. On the east
side is a handsome Roman chapel called Manshack, about
thirty leagues above Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> At 10, the wind rose and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>blew violently, the river much agitated, our boat rocked,
and it was with difficulty we could retain our footing, we
rowed hard to make the lee shore, which we accomplished
at half past ten, opposite a small but neat house on the
western bank, which was occupied by a French family,
chiefly of females. They came to our boat, purchased some
apples, and we made out to understand them. I took a
walk upon the bank, found the garden full of herbs in flower;
by invitation I went to the cottage, and in my way picked
up a sprig of parsley, the family observing me smelling it,
the mother of the children spoke to one of them, and she
ran into the garden and fetched me a nosegay of various
potherbs and flowers, which was a treat so early {331} in
the season—add to this, in consequence of something said
to her by the mother, the little female presented me with
about a quarter of a yard of green riband, with which she
tied the posy. I tarried about twenty minutes and returned
to the boat. The wind having subsided, we pushed off.
At 4, we got into a whirlpool, in which we were detained a
considerable time; this eddy was two miles in circumference,
and the quantity of drift wood in it was astonishing. After
much difficulty we extricated ourselves and regained the
current. As we had now a very quick point to turn, called
Judas’s point, we were forced to the opposite shore, and
dashed against a heap of drift wood. Mr. E. jumped out
on the logs, fixed his shoulder against the boat, and with
the hardness of pushing and thrusting, the blood flew from
his nose; by these efforts however we got her off, but no
sooner were we out of this difficulty than we were drawn
into a second eddy; after taking a round in it we got out
into the current again, and proceeded. During these disasters,
it rained, thundered, and lightened prodigiously. A
few miles lower down, we got into another eddy, and were
actually floating round in it without having observed our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>awkward situation, until called to and informed of it by a
person on shore, who advised us to land until the next
morning, which we did. It thundered, lightened and rained
all night, notwithstanding we slept comfortably.</p>

<p>Feb. 21. We were again blown on shore, but the wind
abating and shifting in our favour we proceeded. We
saw for the first time oranges on the trees hanging in great
plenty. The wind rose in the evening and dashed us against
a tree, the storm continued and we were detained until</p>

<p>Feb. 22. We walked through the fine orange groves,
plucked some fruit, and pushed off, and continued floating
through a country lined with small plantations, and beautiful
houses screened from the {332} sun by orange trees,
whose fruit we saw hanging every where in the greatest
abundance. Having floated nearly all night we landed two
leagues above New Orleans.</p>

<p>Feb. 23. We thought it adviseable to tarry here until
sunrise, on account of the probable difficulty of making a
landing at the city.</p>

<p>At 7, we pushed off. Here indeed the banks of the river
have a beautiful appearance, elegant houses encompassed
by orange groves, sugar plantations, fine gardens, shady
avenues, and the river covered with multitudes of market
boats rowing, some up and others down, all tend to
enliven the views of the passenger, and form a scene truly
delightful.</p>

<p>At a quarter before ten we landed at the city, and after
collecting and packing up my affairs, I went on shore with
captain Payton, of the United States’ army, who had accompanied
us from the camp at Loftus’ heights. We went in
search of lodgings, and after seeing the captain safe, he
being sick, I walked to Madam Shaboo’s, an Irish lady,
who kept a boarding house, chiefly for English and Americans.
She had about fourteen boarders at this time, English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>and American merchants, sea captains, &amp;c. They
were very polite, viewed me obliquely, and no doubt considered
me an eccentrick character. After dinner I went in
quest of Mr. Clark,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> to whom I was recommended for
advice and assistance. He conducted me to Mr. Lanthois,
who I found indisposed. Leaving him I went in quest of
Mons. Gourhon, with whom I also had private business.
Walking afterwards on the levee with Mr. Clark, I was a
little surprised by a gentleman coming up behind me and
catching hold of my hand—it was my old friend doctor
Lacassigne. I had been wishing to see him, he being of a
turn of mind somewhat philosophical, and could interpret
for me, and instruct me in the French language, and having
confidence in him, he {333} was a valuable friend and companion
to me while at Orleans. From the long confinement
to the boat, I found my hams, ancles, and knees so
weak I was obliged to retire from our walk to my lodgings to
rest.</p>

<p>At 4, I got my documents, with general Wilkinson’s letter
of introduction to the governour, and after passing the guards,
was introduced into the presence of his excellency.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> After
examining my papers, he asked me if I had a friend who
could assist me in negociating my business; I replied I had,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>then said he, you must apply to your friend, and if you find
any difficulty, I will redress your grievances, I bowed,
thanked him, and took my leave, feeling well pleased so
far.</p>

<p>Sunday, Feb. 24. After breakfast I went to Mr. E——’s
boat, who I found selling apples wholesale and retail, to a
crowd of people on the shore. Not relishing this kind of
throng of business on a Sunday, I soon retired to my lodgings.
And here I must remark, that there is no distinction
or difference made by the inhabitants between a Sabbath
and any other day in the week, only the stores are fuller of
purchasers on the former, the stalls in the streets covered
with merchandize, the mechanicks engaged at their work,
women seen sewing, and at my lodgings, the female slaves
were ironing linen in the publick room. After dinner, Dr.
Lacassigne called on me and we took a walk around the
skirts of the city. On our way to the upper fort we saw
vast numbers of negro slaves, men, women, and children,
assembled together on the levee, druming, fifing, and dancing,
in large rings. Passing by the taverns or coffee houses, you
may discover gentlemen playing at billiards, and as these
tables are all exposed to publick view by reason of the large
wide doors being left open, no one need be at the trouble of
entering in to satisfy {334} his curiosity. We traversed
round the whole city, which afforded me much amusement.</p>

<p>Feb. 25. In company with the doctor I went up the
river half a mile to the house of Mr. Sarpe, which was
situated in a handsome garden of considerable extent, in
which were fig trees in abundance, pomegranates, and a
large grove of orange trees. And what a little surprised
me was to see three stages of the progression of vegetation
on the same tree at the same time, that is, the blossom, the
green fruit, and those yellow and fully ripe, which was the
situation of the orange trees in Mr. Sarpe’s garden. I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>not been made acquainted with this fact before, and therefore
was obliged to shew my ignorance on the occasion.
Dr. Lacassigne kept his residence here, and had his room
detached from Mr. Sarpe’s house, but in the same garden.
It was surrounded with palisadoes of cypress and lined
within by orange trees, whose fruit suspended on all hands.
The door opened to the river, over the top of the room was
an electrical conductor, the point of which was elevated
three yards above, but divided at the ridge of the house,
and ran down each side of the roof and sides of the wall into
the ground. Owing to the extreme heat of the climate
the air is more frequently inpregnated with electrical fluid,
the clouds more frequently charged and discharged, the
explosions louder, and the preparations to ward off the effect
produced by it more general than in colder climates. The
doctor’s apartment was furnished with a table, two or three
chairs, two beds, and a handsome library, composed of the
Encyclopedia, the works of Voltaire, Rosseau, and a variety
of other works, mathematical, astronomical, philosophical,
French and English. Knowing that I walked with a stick,
the doctor had prepared two, of the young orange tree, and
presented them to me.</p>

<p>{335} Feb. 26. Paid Mr. E— a visit and found him still
busy in selling off his apples, &amp;c.</p>

<p>March 1. Having a fifteen hundred gallon still consigned
to me for sale by Mr. S—, of Pittsburgh, I walked into the
country with the doctor to a Mr. Delongua’s, a distiller of
rum, to see if he would purchase it.</p>

<p>Sunday, March 3, went in company with Mr. Buckley
to the Roman church, found it elegantly ornamented, and
upon the whole to exceed my most sanguine expectations.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
The service was conducted in a manner as bespoke the conductors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>to be no novices. After baptising an infant in a
closet near me, the sermon was introduced by singing, in
which a number of boys and men were engaged, accompanied
by the soft sound of an organ, after which, one of the
priests, (there being three) delivered in the Spanish language
a discourse on the sanctification of the Sabbath. The energetick
manner in which this was done, gave me reason to
believe he felt the force of his own arguments, and the
necessity of a reformation of the Sabbath day in New Orleans.
The service was, as is usual among the Romans, performed
in Latin. It concluded with singing, reading, &amp;c. and I
returned to my lodgings.</p>

<p>At 3 o’clock, P. M. six or eight of the boarders with
myself and the doctor took a walk about two miles from
the city to view an Indian encampment of the Choctaw
nation. We had a shade of full bearing orange trees, to the
gate which we had to pass, near which marched a centinel
to guard a fort a little below, detached from the palisadoes
which surrounded the city. Outside of the gate we saw
a large circular shade for drying and manufacturing bricks,
under which were upwards of fifty Indians of both sexes,
chiefly intoxicated, singing, drinking, rolling in the dirt,
and upon the whole exhibiting a scene very disgustful. We
soon came to another company of {336} ten men sitting in
the middle of the road, all intoxicated, amongst them was
one standing, with a bottle of rum in his hand, whose contents
he alternately administered to the rest, first by shaking
the bottle and then pouring part of its contents into their
mouths. We proceeded, and in our way out, we met numbers
of Indian women with large bundles of wood on their
backs, first tied together and then held by a strap carried
over their foreheads. Thus loaded, they proceed to the
city, while their husbands, (if they may be allowed this
appellation) are spending their time in indolence and intoxication.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>We saw numbers of other women sitting on the
ground making baskets, mats, and sifters for Indian corn.
The children were entirely naked. The chief part of the
men and women that were engaged (for some of them were
sober) were also naked, except a piece of cloth which the men
wore for decency, and a remarkably short petticoat worn by
the women; in every other respect they were entirely naked.
They were thickly encamped in the fields, on the road, and
in almost every direction, some in small cabins covered over
with a shrub like a large fan, called latania, others seated
on the ground and exposed to the heat of the sun. We
walked about among them for an hour, and returned to the
city, where we found upwards of one hundred negroes of
both sexes assembled on the levee, fiddling, dancing, and
singing.</p>

<p>Monday, March 4. Settled some private business, and
some I could not get settled, for some men are not honest,
and others disposed to equivocate, such I found Mons. G—n,
who I should be glad to call by a better name than v——n
or r——l. With whom, however I found Mr. Daniel
Clark, merchant, very useful to me in getting my business
settled. I wrote to Mr. Peacock of Philadelphia by captain
Bradberry.</p>

<p>{337} Thinking about homeward, I visited the brig
Guyoso, in which I intended to sail to Philadelphia. Captain
Mason politely gave up his birth in the cabin to me.
Mr. E—— and four of his men were to go in the same brig,
having sold out his cargo to Mr. M——. Mr. E—— being a
good provider, we engaged him to lay in stores for the cabin.</p>

<p>Having two hours to spare, it may not be amiss to make
a few remarks as to the situation of New Orleans: It is
situated in 29° 59′ north latitude, 14° 53′ longitude west from
Philadelphia. The city is built in an oblong square, parallel
with the river, which runs here nearly north and south. Its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>bed is remarkably deep, but owing to the astonishing quantity
of water which it receives and conducts to the sea, this
scooped cavity is filled and sometimes overflows its banks
and inundates the country for miles, hence the city is low
and flat, and the adjacent grounds damp, of which the following
circumstance is an evidence. In digging the graves
for the dead, before they are dug sufficiently deep, they are
filled with water, and the coffins are generally held just
below the surface until a quantity of sand and gravel is
thrown on to sink them to the bottom. The city is surrounded
by a deep ditch, and pallisadoed on its interior
bank with picketed cypress. This barrier takes its route
round those sides of the city exposed to the land, and joining
the river above and below the town, and is guarded by three
tolerably strong square forts. There are two gates leading
to the interior of the country, guarded by mounts raised on
each side, upon which, cannon are planted. There are
also two other gates about one miles asunder, the one up,
the other down the river, whose entrance is guarded by the
most formidable cannon, with some of their mouths pointing
to the river. Between these two gates are five row gallies,
stationed opposite to the governour’s house, which are
always kept in order and manned {338} ready for action.
The streets are laid out in a straight line from the river
to the ditch and palisadoes, and cross each other in parallel
lines. The principal part of the original plot of the city
is built upon, particularly that next the river. There is a
space of 50 yards between the river and the front row of
houses, which has a beautiful appearance. The houses in
general are not more than one story high, some two, and a
few three stories; the rooms are lofty, and the doors very
wide, to admit a free circulation of air, which in this warm
climate is very necessary.</p>

<p>The channel of the Mississippi, though very deep, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>upwards of a mile wide, would not admit the astonishing
body of water to which it serves as a conduit, had not nature
and art combined to aid this element in its descent to the
ocean: the first in having made a number of outlets, by
which a considerable quantity of the overplus water is carried
off into the swamps and low lands, thence in channels
to the sea: the second in forming a number of mill races cut
through the levee. On these races saw mills are erected for
sawing plank, boards for building houses, and others for
making sugar boxes, which are cut in proper lengths and
exported to the Havannah, where they are bartered for
excellent sugar. It is worthy of remark that the plantations
along the banks of the Mississippi from Natchez to New
Orleans and still lower down, were formerly appropriated
to the culture of indigo and rice, but the demand for these
articles, particularly the first, being on the decline, the attention
of the planters is now turned to that of sugar and cotton,
both of which articles bid for making excellent shipments,
and consequently remittances for dry goods and other articles
imported from Europe.</p>

<p>The houses are in general neat, and some elegant. There
is an elegant Roman church, with a nunnery, in {339} which
the females are instructed and prepared, some for active
life, others for the veil, which is not unfrequent here.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> I
observed one day while standing in the street a little distance
from me, a priest walking with hasty steps on the levee
carrying the host, and three or four other persons carrying
candles in lanthorns; these were followed by a file of musketeers
with bayonets fixed. I was a little struck with surprise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>at this parade, and more so on seeing the inhabitants
kneeling down as it approached. While I was satisfying
my curiosity in observing these people at a distance, the
remark of a certain poet struck me with peculiar force:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Eye nature’s walks, shoot folly as it flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And catch the manners, living as they rise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Monday, March 11. Having got my box and trunk
examined at the custom house, and my mattress and blankets
on board the brig Guyoso, I took my station in the cabin,
where I slept as well as the musquitoes would permit.</p>

<p>March 12. At 12, we set sail, receiving three cheers from
a number of American merchants, supercargoes, and seamen,
assembled on the shore, to whom we replied in the same
manner. Half past three o’clock, we passed the English
turn, five leagues below New Orleans. Wind rather ahead.
At 4, we passed an old fort called St. Mary, on the
right going down. At 7, dropped our anchor and went to
rest.</p>

<p>March 13. As soon as day broke, we were pestered with
astonishing swarms of musquitoes. At six, went on shore
for wood, in getting which the mate got his foot cut very
badly; wheat flour was applied to the wound, by direction
of a prescription book the captain had, and the foot bound
up. Set sail at eight, having been detained by the fog. At
six, {340} came to an old Spanish garrison, called the Plaquemines,
here the flag was hoisted as a signal for us to bring
too, which we obeyed. The captain and supercargo went
on shore in a boat, and produced our passports. The captain
soon hallooed to us to drop the cage anchor. In this we
discovered the ignorance of the Spaniards, for they informed
the captain the water was but fifteen fathoms deep, and it
proved upwards of thirty, which circumstance gave us a
great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>March 14. Detained by the fog till nine o’clock. Beat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>down and tacked, the wind being ahead at one o’clock the
river was still covered with a thick fog. The ocean on each
hand visible from the main-yard, and on the right hand
side we saw the South West pass, one of the outlets or mouths
of the Mississippi to the gulph of Mexico. Ahead we saw
the South and on the left the South East pass, there being
three principal passes to the sea. At three o’clock we came
to these mouths, and the fog mislead us into the South pass,
and we did not discover our error until Mr. E—— and
myself for amusement went up the shrouds upon the main-top
and discovered ahead an island. As soon as this was
proclaimed, the brig put about, and after stemming the
current for an hour we got into the South East pass, which
turns off gradually to the left, and appears to be well exhibited
in Jefferson’s chart, printed in London 12th May,
1794. At 5 o’clock we ran on a shoal on the right hand
side of the South East pass, from which we got off without
damage at six o’clock, when we dropped anchor.</p>

<p>March 15. At 7, went upon deck and found the morning
very damp and raw, a thick mist covered the river, and obscured
the land from our view. In a half an hour the fog
blew over and we could clearly discover about two miles
to the light house, at Balize, and a vessel riding at anchor a
little above it. {341}At nine o’clock came to an anchor
opposite the Balize. Here we took our long boat on board
and prepared for sea. At one o’clock P. M. the pilot came
on board, anchor weighed, we put about, and was under way
in a few minutes. But we were soon enveloped in a thick
fog, and obliged to return to our late station and drop anchor
again.</p>

<p>In the evening I was much pleased with the beauty of
nature as exhibited by the setting sun reflecting its rays upon
the clouds in the western hemisphere, which were beautifully
tinged with a fiery red. The fog had cleared away,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>and there being nothing to interrupt the prospect, it was
delightful beyond description.</p>

<p>March 16. At six A. M. the pilot came on board; at
seven we despatched him again, and we now entered the
gulph of Mexico, our course directly S. E. The brig rolled
and we got sea-sick. Latitude 27 and 46.</p>

<p>March 17. In the evening saw numbers of beautiful
flying fish endeavouring to escape from the pursuit of their
inveterate foe the dolphin.</p>

<p>March 18. Strong N. W. breezes, lat. 25 55. The
19th, 20th and 21st, head winds, much rolling and tossing,
sickness encreased. The 22d, fine weather, becalmed in
the afternoon. At 7, more flying fish skimming the surface
of the sea, indicating the approach of dolphins, to take
which the captain, he being an adept in this business, made
preparations, and caught one weighing 13 pounds, which
was cleansed and set apart for to-morrow’s dinner.</p>

<p>March 23. Saw to the leeward five sail of British ships
of war, one of which was the sloop Stark, 16 guns. After
chasing another American ship, she came after us; we knew
it was in vain to flee, therefore backed our sails till she came
up. She spoke us, sent a boat on board, took our captain
and supercargo, and the brig’s papers. After examining
them, {342} and keeping us two hours in suspense, we were
suffered to depart. We were now in lat. 23. 32, six miles
off the isle of Cuba.</p>

<p>We steered N. W. by N. knowing this direction, aided by
the gulph stream, would bring us to the Marter’s reef on
the Florida shore. At one, dined on our dolphin, a delicious
dish. At four, having passed the tropick of Cancer, saw a
beautiful tropick bird, with a long divided tail, all over white,
shaped like a pigeon, but longer. In the evening we tacked
and steered east, the gulph stream still pushing us forward.</p>

<p>March 24. A British privateer, from Province, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>twelve guns, paid us a visit, and after the usual compliments
of boarding us, and scrutinizing our papers, &amp;c. &amp;c.
and finding <i>all</i> the property on board belonging to American
citizens, on this account we were permitted to depart in
peace, otherwise we should have seen the isle of Providence
without doubt. Another schooner appearing to the windward,
while the lieutenant was yet examining our papers,
hastened him to his own ship, when he immediately gave
chase to it. At 12, we came again in sight of isle of Cuba,
about four leagues off. By the high lands and lofty mountains
we knew it to be that part of the island called the bay
of Hundor, or Honda.</p>

<p>March 25. At 6, we saw to the windward a ship belonging
to Savannah in Georgia, from Jamaica. She had been
driven by the current and contrary winds to a remote part
of the bay, and detained upwards of 30 days. Most of her
hands were sick and in great distress. We this day experienced
a terrible storm, which continued the most of the
night. There is something tremendously awful in the
approach, and raging of a storm at sea, accompanied by
dreadful peals of thunder, quickly following each other,
and the quick flashes of lightning bursting in streams from
the dark and heavy loaded clouds pouring {343} down rain
in torrents. This was the case now, and we prepared for it.
It was the most dreadful storm I ever experienced, and I
could not forbear singing a hymn, applicable to our situation,
namely, “<i>The God that rules on high, and all the earth
surveys</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>March 26. Fine clear morning, with a smooth sea. A
sight of the island of Cuba afforded us a pleasing prospect,
and its high and mountainous banks exhibited a most
romantick scenery.</p>

<p>At 3 o’clock, were agreeably entertained with a fine view
of the city of Havannah, and the Moro castle. We were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>warned of our approach to it by two hills called in the chart
the Maiden’s Paps, on account of their representing the
two breasts of a woman. These two hills, though five
leagues in shore, are plainly discoverable six leagues before
you get opposite to them, and as they are due south of
Havannah, we began to look out for the city, and with our
glasses soon discovered its lofty towers and white buildings,
of which there appeared to be a great number; the strong
castle and battery which guard the city were also in view.
From the Havannah we steered eastward, with a view to see
another hill called the Pan of Matanzas, from which we
were to steer north.</p>

<p>March 27. From the top-mast saw several keys or islands
to the south east. Saw a large shark playing and rolling
along side, and a big turtle.</p>

<p>March 28. Being out of the gulf stream, we were all day
becalmed in lat. 23. 27, opposite the keys on the west end
of the great Bahama bank. Saw swarms of fish, and birds
trying to catch them as they came to the surface of the
water. During our being becalmed, I heard murmurs of
certain individuals as to the <i>cause</i>. One says this is too
much—another, we have some devilment on board, &amp;c.
&amp;c. The breeze springing up in the evening we again
hoisted sail, {344} and during the night had like to have run
on some keys, but fortunately discovered them in time to
tack about.</p>

<p>March 29. Lat. 24. 21. The gulf stream carries us
three knots an hour, but no wind. Saw a large shark along
side, for which the captain threw out a bait of pork; as soon
as the shark saw this he dived, and turned his white belly
upwards, then gradually rising in this position to take the
bait, which he missed, and in turning again the hook caught
him by one of his fins, or broad pieces projecting from his
side which assists him in swimming, and as the cord was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>strong, the captain and three others drew against him, and
after a few flounces, got him along side and drew him upon
the quarter deck. After beating and thumping the deck
like a fury with his head, tail, and fins, the captain laid him
for dead by repeated strokes with the pole of an axe on the
head. He had a small fish called a sucker adhering so
closely to him that it could scarcely be separated. This
small fish was shaped like a cat-fish, and under its head
was a large round substance by which it adhered, or held
itself to the shark. The shark being opened by the cook,
its bowels taken out, and eighteen inches of its body next
the tail (that being the most delicious part) cut out, and its
tail cut off, it was then thrown overboard; and what surprised
me most was that it instantly swam under the brig,
and we perceived it swimming off on the other side as far as
our eyes could distinguish an object under water.</p>

<p>March 30 and 31. Gentle breezes, sailed however about
six knots an hour, being assisted by the gulf stream. I had
now read over all my books, among which I found the most
pleasure in the delightful pages of Baxter’s Saint’s Rest.
My chief companion in the cabin was a Frenchman of the
name of Branie. We reciprocated in improving each other
in our several languages. I found this extremely {345} useful
to me, for I was thereby enabled to count, and ask questions
of business, and for almost any thing I wanted. At 12, lat.
27. 22.</p>

<p>April 1. At 12, lat. 29. 43. Quantity of sea-weed—high
sea—large shark skulking on the star-board side—numbers
of herring hogs playing around us. At nine A. M.
the clouds assumed a threatening aspect, wind, rain, thunder
and lightning unite and rush upon us with fury. The sea
also seemed to enter into the combination against us. In
alternate succession we were raised to the clouds, and the
next moment apparently sunk to the bottom of the sea. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>the cabin we were all struggling to keep ourselves from being
dashed against each other. At half past ten the storm
ceased, and a bowl of grog sent upon deck to treat the sailors.
Lat. 31. 6. The storm again commenced at one, and continued
until 12 o’clock at night.</p>

<p>April 3. Head winds and cloudy, had no observation to
day. The night produced such sudden gusts of wind, as
nearly to throw the brig on her beam ends.</p>

<p>April 4. In the afternoon saw two ships outward bound,
steering S. E. High and contrary winds. Lat. 33. 10.
Another dreadful storm was now preparing to attack us.
At two in the morning was called upon deck by the captain
to view appearances, which were indeed dreadful. The
masts were now all naked, the sails being furled except a
small part of the main sail. The sea swelled, roared, and
by the friction of the vessel acting against the saline and
fiery particles with which the sea is impregnated, it appeared
to vomit forth or emit streams of fire, from the light
of which, and that from the light charged circles with which
the gloomy clouds were environed, we could perceive something
of our situation. The ragings of the storm continued
until</p>

<p>Saturday morning, 7 o’clock, April 6. When we flattered
ourselves with a calm, but in this we were {346} disappointed,
for a hurricane, of which the last was but a prelude,
was now preparing. At 8, the wind shifted from E.
to N. One of the oldest seamen saw the approach of the
storm and gave the alarm. All was on deck in a moment.
It came roaring and foaming upon us most tremendously.
A cotton bag of 317 lbs. which was suspended over the
quarter rail by strong ropes, was blown up and lodged
inside of the rail. The seas broke over us, and I must confess
I expected nothing but a watery grave ere long, for
which I bethought myself, composed my mind to prayer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>recommending my family, and my fellows to the protection
of heaven. In two hours however this dreadful scourge
abated. Not having been able to take any observation, we
supposed ourselves a few miles to the south of cape Hatterass,
off the coast of Carolina.</p>

<p>Sunday, April 7. A fine clear day, not a cloud discoverable,
the sea calm and smooth. With the approbation of the
captain I offered thanks to heaven for our late deliverance.
Observation 35. 25. In the morning saw a brig to windward
making for shore. She appeared to have been labouring
under the same if not more difficulties in the late storm
than ourselves.</p>

<p>Monday, April 8. The wind sprung up from the west
and we shaped our course for Philadelphia. At 12, lat. 36.
48. Seven or eight knots an hour.</p>

<p>April 9. In expectation of making the light house at
cape Henlopen by 4, A. M. we had the preceding evening
made every preparation, the watch was fixed, the lead and
line for sounding during the night. At 12, we got soundings
in 25 fathoms water. Sounding was continued every hour
and at 4, A. M. had 14 fathoms. At 11, a pilot boat boarded
us. At 12, we were opposite the capes of Delaware, and the
light house fair in view. A head wind blowing up, the pilot
steered us over to cape May, and intended {347} to make
cape island, but was prevented, therefore continued along
the Jersey coast, and passed the two mile and five mile
beach, and at four o’clock P. M. anchored in seven fathoms
water about two miles from shore opposite seven mile beach.
The evening was exceedingly cold, after having come immediately
from so warm a climate; this was very disagreeable
to us. We retired however to the cabin, amusing ourselves
by recounting the difficulties of our voyage.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 11. Dropped anchor at 3, P. M. 20
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>miles within the bay of Delaware. Friday 12th, the wind
failed and we dropped anchor again a little below Reedy
island. At 10, A. M. tide being favourable we raised anchor
and continued tacking, and at 6 o’clock dropped our anchor
about four miles below New Castle.</p>

County, Pennsylvania, in 1781, and two years later was made deputy attorney-general
for the county. His speeches greatly inflamed the mob element in the
Whiskey Rebellion, and he was considered the head of the movement; hence, when
amnesty was proclaimed for those who laid down arms, Bradford was omitted
therefrom. He succeeded in escaping, first to Kentucky, where public sentiment
shielded him, then to Bayou Sara, where he obtained a large land grant from the
Spaniards.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Florida, when a fort was built at this point (Fort Bute) to control the pass of the
Manchac (or Iberville) River. It was the centre of an illicit trade up the river, so
that the expression “by way of Little Manchac” became proverbial with the
people of New Orleans to express any form of smuggling. Willing took possession
of Fort Bute for the Americans in 1778, and it was later garrisoned by the Spanish.
Jackson closed the route through the Manchac River in 1814, to prevent British
occupation and it has never since been reopened.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222" class="label">[222]</a> Daniel Clark was the richest and most prominent American in New Orleans.
He came to America from his native Ireland to assist his relative, Colonel George
Croghan, in the conduct of Indian affairs, serving as a clerk to the latter. At the
close of the Revolution, he removed to New Orleans and became a Spanish subject;
but was deeply involved in the plots and intrigues of the Americans. Clark
acted as Wilkinson’s agent throughout, and served Burr on behalf of his principal.
He was chosen member of the first legislative council of Louisiana Territory, but
out of dislike for Claiborne, the governor, declined to serve. The first legislature
of Orleans Territory elected him congressional delegate, and he was in Washington
when Burr was arrested. Later, he turned against Wilkinson because of
the latter’s duplicity to all his accomplices. Clark died in New Orleans in
1815.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

for instructing young women. After the battle of New Orleans, the Ursuline
nuns cared for the sick and wounded, and received the public thanks of General
Jackson. The convent was removed to the suburbs in 1824; but the building is
still used as the (Roman Catholic) archiepiscopal palace of New Orleans.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
